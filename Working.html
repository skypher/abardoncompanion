<h1 align=left><B>Step Four Questions -- Working With the Elements</B></h1>
<p align=left>&copy; 2003<br>
    <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>I&#39;m trying to get my mind around this condensation business, but it gets all gnarled up when I try. I mean, I get that you accumulate the element, then transfer your consciousness to the relevant body part, but then what? I tried stuffing the element into the part from outside, so to speak, but it kind of leaked back out. Then I tried breathing it in after I moved my consciousness into the part, but it didn&#39;t seem right. Then I tried just imagining the quality of the element intensely once I was in the part. That seemed to work the best so far. Is that how ya do it? Any leads? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
      <br>
      Okay. The first part of the exercise (where you&#39;re accumulating the 7 inhalations of the Element in your *whole* body), once you&#39;ve got your whole-body accumulation, then simply visualize/imagine that the accumulation is shrinking down till it occupies only the one small body part/organ. Feel it condensing as it shrinks down.<br>
      <br>
      It&#39;s in the second exercise (where you&#39;re accumulating the Element directly into a body part/organ) that you need to actually transfer your conscious awareness into the respective body part/organ.<br>
      <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>Let&#39;s say that your using a particular finger for an element. As I understand it right now, there are several parts to a practice involving the elements- accumulation in your whole body, condensation into the finger , wish impregnation, deployment internally or externally. That&#39;s about all I really get. Which stages are covered by the ritual? Do you move your finger a different way for each step, or each breath you take when your accumulating? It seems like you&#39;d have a tired little pinky by the end of the day! So let&#39;s say you have your pinky flipping around like a gymnast so you can handle this element. Is this just for a condensation of the element into that finger, or does it handle condensations into any body part? If it&#39;s just for the finger, do I wait until I&#39;m breathing the element in to that finger to start practicing the ritual? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
        <br>
        I think the best way to answer is to describe how I went about it. I&#39;ll describe my first finger ritual with which I wanted to be able to project an immediate stream of the Fire Element from the forefinger of my right hand.<br>
        <br>
        I began by condensing the Fire Element into this finger. Then I impregnated the Element with my desire that it gush forth into whatever I choose. Then, holding this ideation in mind, I curled and then quickly straightened (i.e., pointed) my finger and released a stream of Fire Element from its tip, into an object in front of me. I repeated this endlessly until it became &quot;automatic&quot; (i.e., the accumulation occurred in a split second and as I pointed my finger, the stream of Fire Element was immediately produced), as Bardon instructed. This repetition built a sizeable astral battery of the condensed Fire Element so that eventually, the process of first accumulating the Element into my finger became unnecessary. Ultimately, all I had to do was point my finger with the will that the stream of Fire Element manifest and there it was.<br>
        <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>By the way, why is the second method, breathing directly into a body part called a condensation? It seems like it would just be an accumulation when you do it that way. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
        <br>
        Primarily because you&#39;ve already expanded the tolerance level of your organs through the first exercise. As a consequence, the density of your &quot;accumulation&quot; by the transference method will be equal to a condensation. Any time that the density of an accumulated Element is greater than that of the surrounding, ambient universe, it&#39;s considered a &quot;condensation&quot;.<br>
        <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>Do these same rituals apply when you get to step five and are condensing the elements directly from the universe into an external object? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
        <br>
        They can, but I imagine that &quot;usually&quot; they would be modified. In other words, they can be adapted to reflect your increasing abilities. With a flick of finger you could cause an object to fill itself / be filled with an Element, directly from the universe.<br>
        <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>Then Bardon mentions the positive and negative elements for the right and left hands, but I don&#39;t get it. Do you use one ritual for healing and another for blowing up trains? I mean, I don&#39;t get why you need two different fingers- don&#39;t you just impregnate the element with what ever wish you have, or do you have to decide if it&#39;s positive or negative first? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
        <br>
        It depends upon your needs and your preferences. I suggest that you meditate upon this question a bit more and, of course, experiment! ;-)<br>
        <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>Finally, how is the akasha loaded up by frequent repetition of the exercise? I get that it becomes an automatic function of the imagination, but I don&#39;t get the volt idea, when you discharge the element each time. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  Here the Akasha corresponds to your ideation and your personal force of will. You&#39;re not actually accumulating or condensing the Akasha (an impossibility). Akasha, being the Causal Realm, is manifest as your willed ideation which serves as Primal Cause. The repetition condenses and empowers your ideation and creates a condensation of will power, the two of which become inexorably linked.<br>
  <br>
  At this stage in IIH, the Akasha has not yet been dealt with directly. This comes more with Steps Five and Six, but it does *begin* in Step Four indirectly with the transference of consciousness exercises. However, by the completion of Step Six, you will definitely be able to conduct finger rituals in which you will want to employ the undifferentiated Akasha (i.e., the Akasha separate from the ideation-will combo battery mentioned above). For example, you could create a finger ritual which would (in theory) produce an Elementary being (Step Seven) in an instant and this requires the addition of Akasha (plus the four Elements, of course). This is when giving someone The Finger takes on new (and improved!) meaning! ;-)<br>

<p align=left><br>
  &gt;&gt; <I>Anyhow, thanks for the recent post about <a href="Spontaneous.html">spontaneous magic</a>. I found it very helpful at the stage I am at, as I am still challenged by how to integrate what I know into what I do into the world.&nbsp; First of all, I assume you put the fire element into the soil to<br>
    stimulate growth. Any other reasons? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
    <br>
      A secondary reason was to counteract the tendency of this plant to be sort of soggy.<br>
      <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>Is there a reason that the element should &#39;spin&#39; in this situation? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
    Spinning indicates a cohesive motion, so it in effect brings the whole together in a concerted focus. This can be especially important when using the Fire Element since the Fire is always in motion. Often, that motion loses its focus rapidly and so giving it a specific, organized motion will prolong its focus.<br>
    <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>If you ever feel inspired, I would like to see examples of how you use the fluids, elements and VE in different situations, and specifically why you use one instead of the other, or positive or negative. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  Okay, here&#39;s a few examples:<br>
  <br>
    Fire -- I use the positive Fire to nurture and increase growth (mimicry of the sun) and I use the negative Fire to destroy or to desiccate. For example, a germ can be destroyed with the neg. Fire or made to grow with the pos. Fire.<br>
    <br>
    Air -- Pos. Air can help bring ease or peace to a difficult interaction, such as an argument. Neg. Air can disrupt someone&#39;s intent. For example, if someone is bent on a destructive act, a projection of neg. Air will dissipate their focus.<br>
    <br>
    Water -- Pos. Water can obviously bring fluidity to a sticky situation or an emotional blockage. It can also be use to bring people together. Neg. Water can be induced to abruptly bring out the emotional foundation of a behaviour (although it&#39;s seldom a pretty process) or to completely obliterate a blockage. It can also be used to freeze a situation.<br>
    <br>
    Earth -- Pos. Earth can be used to coalesce a situation, idea, plan, etc. It can also serve as a nutriment to support the operation of the other Elements. The neg. Earth can be used to stop something in its tracks and to create a blockage.<br>
    <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>I am still having trouble seeing where to use the VE in my outer world. I get how to use it for my own development but haven&#39;t used it much for others around me. Any hints? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  The VE can be a great energizer and &quot;aura fluffer&quot;. For example, when someone comes to me down in the dumps or really exhausted and overstressed, I&#39;ll surround them with a cloud of the VE and set it spinning clockwise around them. This always brightens their mood!<br>
  <br>
    My best to you,<br>
    :) Rawn Clark<br>
