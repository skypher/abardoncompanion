      <h1><a name=top></a><B>A Very Modern Question About Astral Projection!</B></h1>
      <p>&copy; 2002<br>
        <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>A question posed itself to me during my meditation the other night. I realize that it is impossible for someone to astrally project themselves past the zone girdling the earth. So what would happen if you were physically on the moon and astrally projected from there. What would happen? Would you die if you tried to leave the zone thingy of the moon?&nbsp; You get the general gist of what I&#39;m asking though... While we&#39;re on the subject, if we were living on another planet, would this mean that there would be different sets of spirits that would have effects on us?&nbsp; If we colonized another planet would we have another equivalent of a zone-girdling thingy? Would this have implications on the locations of our re-incarnations? From what information I have gathered our astral bodies dissolve on the astral plane surrounding the earth, only then do we &quot;reside&quot; in the eternal mental plane. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
The planetary planes or spheres have nothing to do with the physical planets themselves. The connection is purely symbolic and Philosophical. This is true even of the zone girdling the Earth.<br>
<br>
These planes, including the zone, each represent levels or densities of consciousness. Since we have dressed these levels in human symbols, they seem specific to our solar system and our home planet, but they are not. The fact that they do seem this way is due to the nature of human consciousness and not to the levels themselves.<br>
<br>
The reason we dress them in human symbols is because we experience these *universal forces* in a human, Earth-bound context. Nonetheless, they are *universal* forces.<br>
<br>
That means that what we call the zone girdling the Earth is really a zone of a specific level of consciousness (the astral) that surrounds physical matter. ALL physical matter. The entities that inhabit this level of consciousness, manifest within our Earth environment in specific ways; so this, being that it is our only reference, is how we describe and symbolize these otherwise universal forces. Thus we define entities belonging to the degrees of the zodiac (relevant only to Earth) and assign them very Earth focused duties, powers, etc. But again, these Earth-oriented symbols express *universal forces* as they<br>
are perceived through the human eye.<br>
<br>
The same can be said of the Elemental realms and the beings that inhabit them. We dress them in very Earth-bound human symbols, but they are still *universal forces*.<br>
<br>
So, to answer your questions.<br>
<br>
If we lived on planet X, circling the distant star Y, we would have a slightly different set of symbols to describe these universal forces, but they would still be the same universal forces that we were dealing with and trying to describe in terms relevant to our human<br>
experience of planet X. The zone exists in a separate, non-physical dimension, so to speak, in which physical location is irrelevant. In a manner of speaking, this dimension intersects with every point in physical space, simultaneously. When human consciousness rises into this zone, it is not rising into a physical place. Even though planet X is millions of light years away as the crow flies, the zone girdling planet X and the zone girdling planet Earth, are the exact same zone, the exact same astral &quot;place&quot;. Therefore, if I were to rise from planet X into the zone, I would be rising into the same astral &quot;place&quot; as I would if I were to rise from Earth, into the zone. It is the self-same zone and it surrounds ALL physical matter. Of course on planet X, we wouldn&#39;t be calling the &quot;higher&quot; planes, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sol, etc. We would use descriptors that were more relevant to planet X. Nonetheless, each set of descriptors would describe the same universal forces and planes.<br>
<br>
My rising from the Earth zone to the Moon zone would take me to the same &quot;place&quot; as rising from the planet X zone to the next highest &quot;Satellite A&quot; zone.<br>
<br>
Similarly if one were physically standing on our own physical Moon, one would still rise *with their consciousness* into the zone. This zone surrounds ALL physical things. This means that it is not the Moon plane (a mental density of consciousness that has nothing to do with the physical Moon) that surrounds the physical Moon; instead, it is what we Earthlings call the &quot;zone girdling the Earth&quot; that surrounds the physical Moon.<br>
<br>
Your question about whether you&#39;d die if you tried to rise from the Moon, was interesting. What I draw from it is a question whether or not trying to rise into a mental plane, with the astral body, would be harmful. Yes? If that was indeed the essence of your question, then the answer is no, it would not be harmful for the simple reason that it&#39;s not even possible. The astral body is too dense to enter into the purely mental level. It cannot be forced and one cannot accidentally take a wrong turn and end up there, etc. It&#39;s simply impossible. A good physical analogy is straining a pot of lasagna noodles through a colander. The water passes through with ease, but the pasta won&#39;t fit through the small holes. The same applies to the inability of physical matter to penetrate into the astral realm.<br>
<br>
What excites me so much about your questions is their modernity.&nbsp; The fact that we now _do_ think in these terms of the genuine consequences of living on other planets, presents us with an even greater need to understand the difference between our human, Earth-based symbols and the universal forces they represent. We must always remain aware of<br>
the fact that our symbols only *represent* -- they are not the universal forces themselves. We must always look beneath the dressing of symbol and seek out the thing being symbolized.<br>
<br>
My best to you,<br>
