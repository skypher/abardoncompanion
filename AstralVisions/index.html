	<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Ordering the Raw Material of Your 26 Keys</strong></span><br>
	<br>If you have a copy of my book &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/26-Keys-Magic-Astral-Light/dp/1463617674/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312151555&amp;sr=1-1">The 
	26 Keys</a>&quot; and would like to order the calculation of your 26 keys from me 
	rather than calculate them yourself, please write to me by clicking
	<a href="mailto:synthastro@googlemail.com?subject=26 Keys Calculation">here</a>. 
	State the name, birth time, birth place, birth day and year for which the 
	keys are to be created in your message. Please use the actual time on the 
	clock at the moment given for your birth and not any adjusted time. I will 
	send you an invoice through Paypal for the amount of €15 and all 26 keys 
	will then be sent to the return address for your message. I cannot guarantee 
	a time frame for delivery between payment and receipt of your keys because 
	it depends on how many orders I have received but I will aim to fulfill all 
	orders within 2 weeks. If there is a delay expected I will contact you 
	before issuing the invoice. <br><br>Additionally, if you want to order a 12 
	month series of Magnetic conductors for your keys, you can do so in the same 
	way, remembering to specify all your birth details and additionally to state 
	the 12 month period you want to have the conductors for. The cost for this 
	service is €10 and depending on the demands on my time I will aim to send it 
	within a week. <br><br>These services are offered to people who want to 
	engage as soon as possible with the practice described in &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/26-Keys-Magic-Astral-Light/dp/1463617674/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312151555&amp;sr=1-1">The 
	26 Keys</a>&quot;. <br><br>Finally, if you have any questions about the book or 
	you would like to share your experience with me or others, you can write to 
	me personally or join the Facebook group for The 26 Keys. Hope to hear from 
	you!<br><br>everloving,<br>David<br><hr><span id=PubSt1F>

	<span id=PubSt1F0><br>It's been some years since I made the last addition to my pages on astrology at www.astralvisions.de. I've been kept busy in that time and have completed many personal visions for people, growing myself, my understanding of astrology and astral visions itself in the process. This has left me with very little time to update the website. This is now about to change as I am not only going to be making a change in my terms of service, I will also be combining astral visions with Rawn's website, A Bardon Companion. This is such a natural progression it hardly needs any explaining. A Bardon Companion and astral visions have always ultimately been of one mind, as Rawn and I have been. What do need explaining are the new services I am introducing to astral visions.<br></span>
