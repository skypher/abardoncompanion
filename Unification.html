      <h1><a name=top></a><a name=bottom></a><B>UNIFICATION</B></h1>
      <p>&copy; 2003<br>
        <br>
        At this very moment that I begin to write, the sun, having finished with the sign of Pisces, is entering the zodiacal sign of Aries, the Ram. The last degree of Pisces is aptly symbolized by its Sabian symbol: &quot;A seer&#39;s dream now lives: a face carved into huge rocks.&quot; To my mind this reflects the sense of finality that recent world events bring to our collective consciousness. That sense of an anticipated fate&#39;s arrival, too late to avoid or substantially change once here. For most of us, these world events engender a sense of powerlessness; of our individual smallness and inability to make these events go the way *we* want them to. For many of us, our response to our individual powerlessness is to seek out a collective sense of power, be that through gathering in the streets, in our places of worship or in our own homes, friend to friend. Some have recently even discussed the use of magical spells, be they individual or collective, in search of a greater source of power to counter this awareness of our individual powerlessness.<br>
        <br>
        It is my purpose in writing now, as the sun enters the first degree of Aries and the new solar year begins, to invite your participation in an on-going magical unification of consciousness. The focus of this work is to unite in the spirit of Loving Kindness and thereby energize our collective Alikeness. Our deeper commonality, which surpasses and underlies all differences of belief, bias and physical circumstance, is a powerful force which, while it cannot reshape our past, it *CAN* shape our eventual future. The future always was and always will be within *OUR* collective hands to shape . . .<br>
        <br>
        The Sabian Symbol for the first degree of Aries is: &quot;A woman has risen from the ocean; a seal embraces her.&quot; This symbol expresses an emergence from mundane differences and an embracing of &#39;other&#39; at a higher level of commonality. And this is the essence of the method of participation that I wish to suggest. By following this method you will be able to directly participate in the global effort to make the Merciful spirit of Loving Kindness a manifest reality.<br>
        <br>
        The technique I will describe encompasses several possible levels of participation. Your degree of participation will hinge upon your facility with navigating the levels of consciousness available to every living being. The first level is the interpersonal, face to face with another living being, level. Second is the Individual-to-Individual level, where one must attain the &quot;Tiphareth perspective&quot; and engage consciously with other Individual Selves at that level. Third is the level of the Greater or Binah Self in which one rises to their Greater level of awareness and interacts with other Greater Selves at that level. And finally, is the level of The Unity ItSelf.<br>
        <br>
        The point of this is twofold: unification AND the integration of Loving Kindness into the mundane realm. The unification that occurs at higher states of consciousness than the mundane, personal level, is subsequently integrated into each Individual&#39;s personal, mundane consciousness. It&#39;s this *conscious* descent of a collective Loving Kindness into the physical present moment that gives this meditation ritual its magical power.<br>
        <br>
        If you are unfamiliar with the concepts of Individual and Greater Self, then I suggest that you read the following references/explanations available on my website.<br>

        <br>
        Without further ado, here follows the technique itself.<br>
        <br>
        <B><U>COLLECTIVE UNIFICATION THROUGH LOVING KINDNESS</U>:<br>
        </B><br>
        Sit comfortably in front of another living being. It can be another human being, a plant or animal -- the important thing is that it be a living being. Look closely at this other being and notice all of the differences between you. Differences in form, in life circumstances, in thoughts and ideals, in past and future. *SEE* this other being as they are and be aware that you are being seen in return. <br>
        <br>
        Now shift your examination to the similarities that you share with this other being. Focus especially upon the fact that you both exist here and now. Out of the whole infinite span of time and space, here you sit, face to face, one being examining another. You occupy the same moment in time and nearly the same point in space and you are both conscious of this fact. <br>
        <br>
        Open your heart and mind to a deep compassion for this other being and simultaneously sense yourself surrounded by the same force of Loving Kindness emanating from this other. Feel this force of Loving Kindness binding the two of you together via the threads of commonality that exist between you. <br>
        <br>
        Now, if you are able, rise up to the awareness of your Individual Self. Focus intensively upon this perspective and its concomitant sense of detachment from the mundane circumstances of your corporeal existence. Observe how petty these circumstances are from this perspective and how transitory the differences between one person and another truly are in the grander scheme of things. <br>
        <br>
        Now turn your focus upon the Individual Self of the other being and observe it in the same manner as you did its personal, material form. See the differences that exist and which make you each unique. And now observe the similarities that bind you, especially the fact that you are both here and now, observing each other consciously. <br>
        <br>
        Now open your heart and mind to a deep compassion for this other Individual and simultaneously sense yourself surrounded by the same force of Loving Kindness emanating from this other. Feel this force of Loving Kindness binding the two of you together via the threads of commonality that exist between you.<br>
        <br>
        Become aware of your physical selves sitting face to face and sharing this same bond of Loving Kindness. You both exist simultaneously in the same physical time and space as well as this same mental time and place, and you are both conscious of this fact.<br>
        <br>
        Now look outward and sense the countless other Individual Selves who populate this mental time and place. See them just as you&#39;ve seen the other being sitting before you. Note the differences between you which define you each as discrete Individuals and then observe the similarities which bind you together.<br>
        <br>
        Now expand the deep compassion flowing from your heart and mind until it encompasses all of the other Individuals that you perceive and simultaneously sense yourself surrounded by the same force of Loving Kindness emanating from these others. Feel this force of Loving Kindness binding the lot of you together via the threads of commonality that exist between you all.<br>
        <br>
        Again become aware of your physical selves existing on the same planet earth and sharing this same bond of Loving Kindness. You all exist simultaneously in the same physical time and space as well as this same mental time and place, and you are all conscious of this fact.<br>
        <br>
        Now, if you are able, abandon the constraints of time and space and rise up to the awareness of your Greater Self. Focus intensively upon this perspective and its concomitant sense of timeless Understanding. Observe the infinite flow of temporal events and bask in the Understanding of their ultimate rightness. See how the horrors of the past, present and future are all one. Understand and Know that All is connected and part of The One Thing.<br>
        <br>
        Observe the other Greaters who surround you and consciously acknowledge them. Bathe them all in the force of Loving Kindness and together bless the entire temporal realm with this same force of Loving Kindness. Face the Greater Self of the other being you sit face to face with in the physical realm and deepen the bond of Loving Kindness between the two of you. If perchance you find that you exist as Individual parts of the same Greater Self, then bask in the joy of your mutual awareness.<br>
        <br>
        Now become aware of your Individual Selves, face to face and sharing this same bond of Loving Kindness. You both exist simultaneously in the same mental time and place, as well as this eternal joining, and you are both conscious of this fact. Hold this simultaneous awareness of the Greater and Individual levels of your awareness and become aware of your physical selves existing on the same planet earth and sharing this same bond of Loving Kindness. You exist simultaneously in the same physical time and space, the same mental time and place, as well as this eternal joining, and you are both conscious of this fact.<br>
        <br>
        And now, if you are able, arise together into the Unity of The One Self. Focus intensively upon this perspective and its concomitant sense of All Knowing, All Understanding and All Wisdom. Experience The Whole and BE Loving Kindness. Become particularly aware of the Greater, Individual and personal levels of Self and carry the Force of Loving Kindness all the way down into the temporal moment of sitting face to face with another living being. In this way, bind the *conscious* awareness of The Unity with the Greater, Individual and material levels of Self, all the way down to the infinitely finite present moment of physical time and space.<br>
        <br>
        When you are done, return to your normal waking consciousness, and focus your awareness into your physical body. Look out of your eyes at the other being who sits in front of you and become aware of the levels at which you share commonality with this other being. Again project and simultaneously receive the force of Loving Kindness here, at this material level. Take this feeling with you as you go about your business and spread it likewise to every other being you encounter.<br>
        <br>
        My love to you all,<br>
