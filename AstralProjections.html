<h1 align=justify><B>On Attaining Temporal Control Over<br>
  Spontaneous Astral Projections </B></h1>
<p align=justify>&copy;&nbsp; 2001<br>
    <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>I have had limited experiences with OBEs; approximately eleven that I can recall in detail. In most of these experiences I have projected spontaneously into what I believe is the Real Time Zone (according to Robert Bruce&#39;s terminology in his Astral Dynamics book). </I>&lt;&lt; <br>
      <br>
      I haven&#39;t yet read any of Robert&#39;s books but I think I recognize what he means by &quot;Real Time Zone&quot;. In other words, this is past-present-future <I><B>physical</B></I> time (i.e., things that have happened, are happening or will happen within the physical realm), as opposed to astral or mental happenings that have no physical corollary. <br>
        <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>Most of these experiences have occurred in what I believe to have been the past (in our linear understanding of time). So my question to you, seeing as I have not found any details in the subject matter elsewhere, is: Are there any methods or practical ways to obtain temporal control over one&#39;s projections? </I>&lt;&lt; <br>
        <br>
        With spontaneous or unintentional separation, it is difficult to control the astra-mental time factor. Time in these realms is very different than physical time. Primarily, it depends upon your conscious intent. In other words, if you consciously project into the physical-present astra-mental moment, that is when you will arrive. But since your separation is spontaneous and unintentional, you have no *conscious* control over this factor. <br>
        <br>
        The study of &#39;time&#39; is important to the magician as its understanding reveals many mysteries. The central mystery here concerns the nature of &quot;now-ness&quot;. Now-ness is what determines which moment of time you are in. Generally we experience now-ness only in our present moment of physical-time. But with astra-mental time, we are not restricted in this way. For example, in a daydream we can mentally visit (albeit unreliably) any time we can imagine. In other words, the mind can access any moment in time and still experience now-ness, whereas the physical body can only experience now-ness in the physical-present moment. <br>
        <br>
        Essentially, our mental body exists in a bubble of now-ness that we always carry with us. No matter where your mental body resides, it senses &quot;now&quot;. Thus, when it is combined with your astral body and inhabiting your physical body, that now-ness encompasses only the briefest of physical-moments. And when your conjoined astra-mental body is separate from the physical body, you have more latitude through time and can move your bubble of now-ness anywhere you please. The same is true with the solitary mental body, except that with your solitary mental body you can encompass more of time within your bubble of now-ness. Thus it is that only your solitary mental body can experience eternity (i.e., encompass the whole infinite passage of time within a single &quot;now&quot;). <br>
        <br>
        When you project *consciously* you are taking your bubble of now-ness and intentionally relocating it to a locale of your own choosing. <br>
        <br>
        Have you ever projected consciously and with the clear intention to do so? This is the key to your dilemma: *conscious* projection. <br>
        <br>
        Achieving conscious control over the projection of the astra-mental body is no easy matter, but since you are naturally able to project spontaneously, you are half-way there already. :) There are three factors to cultivate in order to gain this ability: 1) Mental Discipline. 2) Elemental Equilibrium. 3) Mental Projection (Wandering/Travel). <br>
        <br>
        1) Mental Discipline: It is essential that you be able to focus your mind without wavering. This is important because you will be faced with sensations and experiences that can easily disrupt your normal equilibrium or distract your focus. Secondarily, mental discipline is necessary for the conscious formation of your intent to project to a specific time and place. <br>
        <br>
        2) Elemental Equilibrium: Achieving a high degree of Elemental Equilibrium is an essential prerequisite to the conscious separation of your astra-mental body. Without this Equilibrium, you risk damage to yourself. The fact that you are naturally able to spontaneously project, indicates that you already possess a rudimentary Equilibrium, but in order to get your projection under your conscious control requires further work in this regard. The important factor here is the mastery of your subconscious mind. I say this because your intention must come from your conscious mind instead of from your subconscious mind. Your present situation of spontaneous projection into the past indicates a subconscious motivation. <br>
        <br>
        3) Mental Wandering: Mental wandering is much simpler and easier to master than the astral projection. Here you will learn all the techniques necessary for *conscious* projection, including the conscious projection into a time/place of your own choosing. I consider mental wandering, in the normal course of training, to be a prerequisite to astral wandering. This will also teach you how to verify that your astra-mental experiences are genuine and not merely fantasy.<br>
        <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>If so, would you be so kind as to refer me to some text where I may read up on this? Or perhaps you can explain to me in your own words on how this may be achieved or why not? </I>&lt;&lt; <br>
        <br>
        I recommend Franz Bardon&#39;s &quot;Initiation Into Hermetics&quot;. In Step 8 and Step 9, Bardon explains both mental and astral wandering (projection) and the methodology for attaining it. In the Steps 1 through 7, Bardon outlines the prerequisite training. <br>
        <br>
        Another resource I recommend are two of my own writings, found on my website.&nbsp; They are: &quot;Beneath An Astral Moon&quot; and &quot;Rawn&#39;s Self-Healing Archaeous&quot;. Both deal with astra-mental separation. &quot;Beneath An Astral Moon&quot; describes a more rudimentary approach that may indeed be helpful to you currently, and &quot;Archaeous&quot; describes a more advanced technique which if you adapt slightly, may also be helpful in developing a more conscious projection.<br>
        <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>At the moment I am interested in projecting into the present, but would also be curious to understand the methods for past and future projection control. </I>&lt;&lt; <br>
        <br>
        I suggest that the next time you spontaneously project, you attempt to take conscious control of the situation. Begin by stopping yourself and standing very still in whatever place/time you find yourself. Take a few moments to sense your situation. Focus on the sensations you are feeling, the emotions you are experiencing and the thoughts that are running through your mind. When you feel centered and grounded, then explore your surroundings *consciously*. Try to figure out what drew you to this specific time/place. If, as I suspect, you are being drawn to this place/time because of a subconscious motivation, then getting to know what that motivation is, would be very wise and very educational. <br>
        <br>
        You might also experiment with consciously controlling the time you find yourself in. In other words, make up your mind that you will be in the present physical-time moment instead of the past-time moment you find yourself in. Once your mind is set, *will* yourself to be in the present moment. In this realm, <I><B>mind powered by force of will</B></I>, is THE controlling factor. <br>
        <br>
        Similarly, if you find yourself conscious during the act of projection itself (i.e., as your astra-mental body is separating from your physical body), try to focus your mind on the goal of projecting into the astra-mental aspect of the physical-present moment. The trick to this is to stay very close to your physical body. In other words, don&#39;t allow yourself to project in some other situation or location of the physical-present moment. Begin close to your physical body and ground yourself in the physical-present. Only then, venture forth to other places within the physical-present moment. <br>
        <br>
        The main issue here is *conscious* control. Once you assume this control, you will be able to project any where or any when you desire. But to reach this state of mind, you must focus upon more of your overall development than just OBE. The path of Hermetics is one of <I>balance</I>. <br>
      <br>
  My best to you, <br>
