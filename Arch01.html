  <B>Introduction:<br>
  </B><br>
    Hello, this is Rawn Clark and you&#39;re listening to Lesson One of the Self-Healing Archaeous.<br>
  <br>
    I call this technique an archaeous because it&#39;s patterned after an Alchemical work known as the archaeous of water.&nbsp; In this alchemical work, one takes a volume of water and separates it into its Elements through a process of distillation.&nbsp; Once the parts are separated and purified, they are recombined or re-integrated, resulting in empowered water that has faculties it didn&#39;t possess before.&nbsp; The self-healing archaeous follows this same alchemical pattern of separation, purification and subsequent re-integration, but instead of water, our subject is the three part human body.<br>
  <br>
    Like Bardon, the Archaeous defines three &quot;bodies&quot; which correspond to three &quot;realms&quot;: Mental, Astral, and Physical.&nbsp; The healing effects of the Archaeous are achieved through the conscious manipulation of these three bodies, and <I>most especially</I>, through their integration.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
      At every step in the Archaeous, one works in conscious cooperation with the pathways of influence and power which Nature herself provides.&nbsp; The technique mimics one of Nature&#39;s most essential processes: Integration + Separation + Re-integration . . . the rhythm of life itself.&nbsp; To this fundamental equation, is added the practitioner&#39;s own magical will, along with the focus of healing.<br>
  <br>
      Lessons one, two and three, are concerned with the complete awareness of each body and their integration with each of the others.&nbsp; Lesson one with the complete awareness, relaxation and integration of the physical body; lesson two with the complete awareness of the astral body and its conscious integration with the physical body; and, lesson three with the complete awareness of the mental body and its conscious integration with the astral and physical bodies.<br>
  <br>
      Lessons four and five are concerned with the passive separation of these bodies, one from the other, and with their subsequent re-integration.&nbsp; During the period of separation, each body naturally achieves a degree of rest unknown to it by any other means.&nbsp; The archaeous takes full advantage of this healing by-product of their restful solitude.<br>
  <br>
      Lesson Six is concerned with the purification and balancing of each solitary body and the subsequent re-integration of these balanced bodies.&nbsp; This is achieved through the loading of each body with the four Elements in their appropriate regions.<br>
  <br>
      The final lesson, seven, is concerned with a higher form of integration -- that of integrated self-expression through your consciously unified and Elementally balanced physical-astral-mental body.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
      The archaeous is designed to be pursued in conjunction with the work of Initiation Into Hermetics.&nbsp; Lessons one, two and three, which are focused upon integration, are suitable at any of Bardon&#39;s Steps.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
      Lessons four and five however, which are focused upon separation, should only be pursued after the completion of Step Two and the attainment of the rudimentary Elemental Equilibrium.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
  <br>
      Lesson six, which pertains to manipulation of the Four Elements, should only be pursued after good progress has been achieved with Step Four and the work of accumulating the Elements.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
      And finally, lesson seven should not be undertaken until the work of Step Six is begun.<br>
  <br>
      So, let&#39;s move on to the practice of lesson one and the complete awareness, relaxation and integration of the physical body.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <B>Practice:<br>
  </B><br>
    Close your eyes and situate yourself comfortably.&nbsp; It is best is if you sit upright, with your hands resting gently on your thighs, as this will help you resist the temptation to fall asleep during the relaxation phase.<br>
  <br>
    Clear your mind of all unwanted, mundane concerns and thoughts.&nbsp; Now focus your attention upon your feet.&nbsp; Become aware of how your feet feel.&nbsp; Sense the toes and the arches and the tops of your feet.&nbsp; Now relax all the tension in your feet.<br>
  <br>
    Move your awareness upwards to your calves.&nbsp; Similarly, become aware of how your calves feel and relax away all of the tension stored in their musculature.<br>
  <br>
    Now move your awareness to your thighs.&nbsp; Note how they feel and relax their muscles.<br>
  <br>
    Now move to your buttocks and groin and relax all of the muscles in this area.<br>
  <br>
    Relax all the tension from your abdomen and gut.<br>
  <br>
    From your lower back.<br>
  <br>
    Your upper back.<br>
  <br>
    Release all the tension from your chest.<br>
  <br>
    Relax your shoulders, arms and hands.<br>
  <br>
    Relax all the muscles in your neck.<br>
  <br>
    Relax your jaw and mouth.<br>
  <br>
    Relax your nose.<br>
  <br>
    Your eyes.<br>
  <br>
    Your cheeks.<br>
  <br>
    Your ears.<br>
  <br>
    Now relax your scalp.<br>
  <br>
    Focus on how relaxed your entire body is at this moment.<br>
  <br>
    Now focus your awareness in the Fire region of your head, from the base of your neck to the top of your scalp.&nbsp; Sense all of the various parts that compose this region.&nbsp; Sense the skin that covers your head and face.&nbsp; Sense your eyes, right and left; your nose and sinuses; your ears, right and left; your tongue, teeth and lips.&nbsp; Sense your neck and throat.&nbsp; Now sense all the parts of your head region at once.&nbsp; Put all of these sensations together and sense your whole head region as a single unit.<br>
  <br>
    Now move your awareness down to the Air region of your chest, from the tops of your shoulders down to your solar plexus, plus your upper arms, right and left, down to your elbows.&nbsp; Sense all of the various parts that compose this region.&nbsp; Sense the skin that covers your torso.&nbsp; Sense the skin, muscle and bone of your right upper arm and shoulder.&nbsp; Sense the skin, muscle and bone of your left upper arm and shoulder.&nbsp; Sense your breathing lungs and your beating heart.&nbsp; Sense your upper spine, your ribs and your breast.&nbsp; Now sense all parts of your chest region at once.&nbsp; Put all of these sensations together and sense your chest region as a single unit.<br>
  <br>
    Now move your awareness down to the Water region of your abdomen, from the bottom of your sternum down to just above your genetalia, plus your forearms, right and left, from elbows to wrists.&nbsp; Sense all the various parts that compose this region.&nbsp; Sense the skin that covers your abdomen and lower back.&nbsp; Sense the skin, muscle and bone of your right elbow and forearm.&nbsp; Sense the skin, muscle and bone of your left elbow and forearm.&nbsp; Sense your stomach, your intestines, your kidneys and the all other organs that fill your abdomen.&nbsp; Sense your lower spine and all the musculature that supports your abdomen.&nbsp; Now sense all the parts of your abdominal region at once.&nbsp; Put all of these sensations together and sense your abdominal region as a single unit.<br>
  <br>
    Now move your awareness down to the Earth region of your legs, from the top of your hips down to the soles of your feet, plus your wrists and hands, right and left.&nbsp; Sense all the various parts that compose this region.&nbsp; Sense the skin, muscle and bone of your right wrist and hand.&nbsp; Sense the skin, muscle and bone of your left wrist and hand.&nbsp; Sense the skin and muscle of your buttocks and the bone of your pelvis.&nbsp; Sense your genetalia.&nbsp; Sense the skin, muscle and bone of your right thigh, your right calf, and your right foot.&nbsp; Sense the skin, muscle and bone of your left thigh, your left calf, and your left foot.&nbsp; Now sense all the parts of your leg region at once.&nbsp; Put all of these sensations together and sense your leg region as a single unit.<br>
  <br>
    Sense the solid, supportive, Earth nature of this region as a whole.&nbsp; It is the solid foundation upon which you stand.<br>
  <br>
    Now, retain your awareness of the Earthy leg region and add the Watery region of your abdomen to this awareness.&nbsp; Sense your leg region and your abdominal region simultaneously.&nbsp; Sense the fluid, digestive Water nature of your abdominal region and let it float atop the solid Earth region of your legs.&nbsp; Sense how the Water nature of your abdominal region penetrates the uppermost layer of the Earth nature of your leg region, binding the two regions together.<br>
  <br>
    Now retain this awareness of the conjoined Earth and Water regions, stretching from the bottoms of your feet up to your sternum, and add the Air region of your chest to this awareness.&nbsp; Sense your leg region, your abdominal region and your chest region simultaneously.&nbsp; Sense the respiring, light Air nature of your chest region and let it hover over the fluid Water region of your abdomen, which floats atop the solid Earth region of your legs.&nbsp; Sense how the Air nature of your chest region mingles with the uppermost layer of the Water nature of your abdominal region, binding the two regions together.&nbsp; Sense how these three regions connect, one to the other and form a conjoined whole.<br>
  <br>
    Now retain this awareness of the conjoined Earth, Water and Air regions, stretching from the soles of your feet up to the tops of your shoulders, and add the Fire region of your head to this awareness.&nbsp; Sense your leg region, your abdominal region, your chest region and your head region simultaneously.&nbsp; Sense the active, expressive Fire nature of your head region and let it dance upon the Airy nature of your chest region, which hovers over the Watery nature of your abdominal region, which in turn, floats atop the solid Earthy nature of your leg region.&nbsp; Sense how the Fire nature of your head region consumes the uppermost layer of the Air nature of your chest region, binding these two regions together.&nbsp; Sense how these four regions connect, one with the other, to form a single body.<br>
  <br>
    Sense your entire body as a single unified whole.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
    Now visualize roots growing downward from the base of your spine, the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet.&nbsp; Cause them to burrow deep into the soil below your feet.&nbsp; From the soil below you, draw whatever energetic nutrients your body needs, up into the Earth region of your body.&nbsp; Sense how the Water region passes these energetic nutrients to the Air region and how the Air feeds them to the Fire region.&nbsp; Sense how the Fire region, thus nourished, sends a return energy downward into the Air region, which in turn is passed by the Air to the Water region.&nbsp; Sense how this energy flows from the Water region, down into the Earth region and back, through your roots, to the soil below your feet.<br>
  <br>
    Release any excess energy you may sense within your body, through your roots and into the soil below.&nbsp; Release any negativity you may harbor, through your roots and into the soil below.<br>
  <br>
    Now turn your awareness away from your roots and return to sensing your whole body.&nbsp; Sense the unification of the four regions.<br>
  <br>
    Now begin your return to normal awareness.&nbsp; Before opening your eyes or moving your body, take a moment to listen to the noises around you, to smell the air, etc.&nbsp; Now take a deep breath and exhale it gently.&nbsp; Now move your hands up along your thighs and up your abdomen and chest, up to your face and back down again, awakening your body to normal sensation.&nbsp; Now gently open your eyes and slowly begin to physically move about.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
    This ends lesson one of the Self-Healing Archaeous concerning the complete awareness, relaxation and integration of the physical body.<br>
  <br>
    I suggest that you use this recording as your guide only for as long as it takes you to learn this technique.&nbsp; Once you have memorized the working pattern and have succeeded in following along with this recording a couple of times, you should try the technique solo, without the use of this recording.&nbsp; It is imperative that you learn to perform this technique without my guiding voice if you wish to continue on to the next lessons.<br>
  <br>
    When this technique becomes easy for you to perform, you may move on to lesson two and the complete awareness and integration of the astral body.<br>
  <br>
    My best to you!
