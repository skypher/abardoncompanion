<p align=justify></U></B><B><br>
  </B>Hello, this is Rawn Clark bringing you Lesson Six in the Self-Healing Archaeous.&nbsp; This Lesson is suitable only for those who have made good headway with the work of Step Four of IIH and are already proficient with accumulating the Elements.<br>
  <br>
  Our subject in this lesson is the Elemental balancing of each of our three bodies.&nbsp; Mastery of Lesson Five is an absolute prerequisite for the pursuit of this Lesson since the Elemental balancing work requires a separation of the three bodies.<br>
  <br>
  This Lesson of the Archaeous is an extension of an exercise found at the end of the astral training of Step Four in &quot;Initiation Into Hermetics&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;In Bardon&#39;s version, the student accumulates the Elements into their respective regions of the physical body in order to attain an Elemental harmony.&nbsp; In the Archaeous however, we will be accumulating the Elements into all three of our bodies and will thereby attain a deeper degree of Elemental harmony.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  We will begin with the mental body, then the astral body and end with the physical body.&nbsp; Great care is taken with the process of re-integrating the mental and astral bodies, and with re-integrating the astra-mental and physical bodies.&nbsp; In this way, the mental body&#39;s Elemental harmony is brought from the mental, into the astral and then reaffirmed by accumulating the Elements into the astral body.&nbsp; Then the astra-mental harmony is brought from the astral, into the physical and again reaffirmed by accumulating the Elements into the physical body.<br>
  <br>
  Since the work of Lesson Six requires a very deep level of concentration and separation of the three bodies, I will not be guiding you through the process as I did in the previous Lessons.&nbsp; Instead, I will be describing the process and it will be up to you to then put it into practice.<br>
  <br>
  So, let&#39;s move on to a description of the practice.<br>
  <br>
  You begin as usual and work your way through the Archaeous up until the point at which your three bodies are separated and your focus of awareness is solely within your solitary mental body.&nbsp; This is the point at which Lesson Six begins.<br>
  <br>
  Turn your solitary mental body until you are gazing at your resting astral and physical bodies.&nbsp; Take note of the cord connecting your solitary mental body to your resting astral body and the cord connecting your astral body with your resting physical body.<br>
  <br>
  Focus upon the cord connecting your astral and physical bodies.&nbsp; As you know, this is the Earth region of your mental body.&nbsp; Your first task is to fill the Earth region of your mental body with the Earth Element.&nbsp; Do not accumulate a great amount of the Element -- only enough to fill the cord.&nbsp; You don&#39;t want to condense the Element, so this is to be just a gentle filling of the Earth region with the Earth Element.<br>
  <br>
  Now focus your attention upon the cord connecting your resting astral body and your solitary mental body.&nbsp; As you know, this is the Water region of your mental body.&nbsp; Your next task then, is to fill the Water region of your mental body with an equal amount of the Water Element.&nbsp; As before, do not accumulate too much of the Element -- only fill the cord without condensing the Element.<br>
  <br>
  When the Earth and Water regions of your mental body have been filled with their respective Elements, turn your focus upon the Air region of your solitary mental body.&nbsp; Your next task is to fill the Air region with an equal amount of the Air Element in the same manner as before.&nbsp; Again, just fill the Air region with the Air Element; don&#39;t condense the Element.<br>
  <br>
    Then turn your focus to the Fire region of your solitary mental body and fill it with an equal amount of the Fire Element, exactly as before.<br>
    <br>
    When all four regions of your mental body are thus filled with an equal amount of their respective Elements, spread your awareness throughout your entire mental body (all four regions simultaneously).&nbsp; Spend several moments of meditation in this state of integrated balance.<br>
    <br>
    When your meditation feels complete, release the accumulated Elements in reverse order, starting with the Fire and ending with the Earth.&nbsp; When you are done, spend a few moments sensing the Elemental harmony and balance within your mental body.<br>
    <B><br>
    </B>Now turn your attention to your reclining and fully rested astral body.&nbsp; Gently sink down into it and regain full awareness of it.&nbsp; Consciously permeate it as usual, linking your astral and mental bodies intimately together.&nbsp; When you are ready, stand up with your astral-mental body, paying close attention to reconnecting with all of the astral sensations.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Stand still and closely integrate your astral and mental bodies.&nbsp; Consciously vitalize your astral body with the Elemental Equilibrium of your mental body.&nbsp; Bring the balancing influence of your re-vivified mental body firmly into all aspects of your rested astral energy.&nbsp; Special attention must be given to this re-integration.&nbsp; Take your time and be as thorough as possible.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Once you have fully reclaimed your astral body, turn your focus upon the Earth region of your astral body and fill it with the Earth Element.&nbsp; As with the filling of the mental body, you do not want to condense the Element, just fill the region.<br>
    <br>
    Then turn your attention to the Water region of your astral body and fill it with an equal amount of the Water Element.&nbsp; Follow this by filling the Air region of your astral body with the Air Element and then the Fire region with the Fire Element.<br>
    <br>
    When all four regions of your astral body are thus filled with an equal amount of their respective Elements, spread your awareness throughout your entire astral body (all four regions simultaneously).&nbsp; Spend several moments of meditation in this state of integrated balance.<br>
    <br>
    When your meditation feels complete, release the accumulated Elements in reverse order, starting with the Fire and ending with the Earth.&nbsp; When you are done, spend a few moments sensing the Elemental harmony and balance within your astral body.<br>
    <B><br>
    </B>Now turn your focus to your resting physical body and re-integrate your astral-mental body and resting physical body.&nbsp; Spend several moments upon this process of re-integrating your physical-astra-mental body.&nbsp; Consciously integrate the Elemental harmony of your astra-mental body into every aspect of your physical body.&nbsp; Special attention must be given to this re-integration.&nbsp; Take your time and be as thorough as possible.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Once you have fully reclaimed your physical body, turn your focus upon the leg region of your physical body and fill it with the Earth Element.&nbsp; As before, you do not want to condense the Element, just fill the region.<br>
    <br>
    Then turn your attention to the abdominal region of your physical body and fill it with an equal amount of the Water Element.&nbsp; Follow this by filling the chest region of your physical body with the Air Element and then the head region with the Fire Element.<br>
    <br>
    When all four regions of your physical body are thus filled with an equal amount of their respective Elements, spread your awareness throughout your entire physical body (all four regions simultaneously).&nbsp; Spend several moments of meditation in this state of integrated balance.<br>
    <br>
    When your meditation feels complete, release the accumulated Elements in reverse order, starting with the Fire and ending with the Earth.&nbsp; When you are done, spend a few moments sensing the Elemental harmony and balance within your physical-astra-mental body.&nbsp; Concentrate upon the sensations caused by this re-vivifying Equilibrium of your three bodies united.&nbsp; Integrate every bit of astral-mental energy you can into your physical structure, consciously guiding it into every cell of your physical body.&nbsp; And then release whatever excess energy remains.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Visualize your mental body as actively brightening, and willfully giving direction to, the astral.&nbsp; Also visualize the physical conforming its structure into agreement with this renewed astral template.&nbsp; This final integration and balancing should be pursued with the utmost care and concentration.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    End your meditation in the usual manner, being absolutely sure to make a full return to normal, waking consciousness.<br>
    <br>
    So, to summarize the process:&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    First you follow the Archaeous up to the point at which all three bodies are separated and your awareness is firmly rooted in your solitary mental body.<br>
    <br>
    Then you load each of the four Elemental regions of your mental body with their respective Elements, starting with Earth and ending with Fire.&nbsp; After a few minutes in this state, you release the Elements in reverse order, from Fire to Earth.&nbsp; Upon completion, you re-integrate your solitary mental body with your resting astral body.<br>
    <br>
    You then repeat the same exercise with your astral body by filling each region with its respective Element.&nbsp; After a few minutes the Elements are released in reverse order and you re-integrate your astra-mental and physical bodies.<br>
    <br>
    The same work is repeated with your physical body.&nbsp; Again, fill each region with its respective Element and then, after a few minutes, release the Elements in reverse order.<br>
    <br>
    Achieving the fully integrated and Elementally balanced physical-astra-mental body is the most healing level of the Archaeous.&nbsp; To quote Bardon, &quot;If the magician should ever get into disharmony through any particular circumstances, all he has to do is practice these exercises and he will immediately redress the harmony.&nbsp; He will experience the comforting influence of the entire universal harmony, which is creating and keeping in him the feeling of peace and happiness, not only for a few hours, but for days.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    This concludes Lesson Six of the Self-Healing Archaeous, concerning the Elemental balancing and re-integration of the three bodies.&nbsp; I wish you much peace, happiness and Elemental harmony!<br>
    <br>
    My best to you!<br>
