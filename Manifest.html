      <h1><a name=top></a><B>Manifestation</B></h1>
<p><B>By EMC </B><br>
                &copy; 2003<br>
                <br>
                Some thoughts on manifestation...<br>
                <br>
                It&#39;s a weird thing about Bardon. I&#39;ve found myself, in the past, going off on tangents to Bardon and exploring all sorts of sundry techniques and more immediately seductive byways of magic and enchantment. And, after these long loops, I find myself back to discover the essence of my new experience was actually distilled in some form or another in<br>
                Bardon&#39;s IIH. The reason I didn&#39;t seen it, at first, was that in his written form it is sometimes difficult to pick out where the emphasis should be. Or he will mention something seemingly in passing that is a critical distinction in the effectiveness of a technique or practice. Some of these distinctions, especially for manifestation, are packed into the first two steps. <br>
                <br>
                The model of magical manifestation, as I work with it to date, deals with bringing a form down through 4 layers into the physical. The shifting from one layer to the next needs to be smooth an integral... A martial arts example is &quot;punching with your feet.&quot; Force is transmitted through the linking your entire body into one fluid and coordinated movement. <br>
                <br>
                In manifestation, I believe this movement must start *well* in the mental. This can mean a couple of things.<br>
                <br>
                1. Clear outcome. You have to know what it is, specifically, that you want so your intent is not ambiguous or ill-defined. If you can&#39;t see this clearly in your imagination you cannot coalesce a structure for the energy to manifest materially. <br>
                <br>
                2. Your thought-form needs to be strong, not a nebulous wish. Strong has some very quantitative measures. For example... you should be able to hold this intent for at least 17 seconds for it to have the slimmest chance of making it any further than just a random thread which is the typical nature of most everyday thinking. Strength also pertains to how vivid you can make this thought form. <br>
                <br>
                Once you have a finely honed thought-form, which is actually the building blocks of exercises in step 1 and 2 you need to link it to energy. Energy as a property of the astral and the emotions -vs- the mental plane.<br>
                <br>
                Here it&#39;s easy to make a mistake, even if you created the thought-form impeccably and have collected the typically nebulous, diffused energy of the tick-tock mind into a focused, compact intent of magical volition.<br>
                <br>
                There&#39;s a tendency for us to think &quot;about&quot; something or to think &quot;of&quot; something -vs- a more powerful way of forming this directional energy on the astral, Neville captures this distinction in his excellent book &quot;Awakened Imagination&quot; as follows:<br>
                <br>
                &quot;...we must use imagination masterfully, not as an onlooker thinking *of* the end, but as a partaker thinking *from* the end. We must actually *be* there in imagination. If we do this, our subjective experience will be realized objectively.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Of course, this is stated in Bardon more succinctly with his advice to use impregnation as-if you already contained the quality you seek. <br>
                <br>
                The key is to invoke this energy with the feeling of you already having accomplished your goal and experiencing now how it will feel &quot;then.&quot; You may often discover, in this step, that it is not really or exactly what you wanted, and you&#39;ll need to go back to work again on clarifying your intent. This usually indicates parts of yourself that are not aligned with your goal and that would have ultimately sabotaged your intent. <br>
                <br>
                I believe this also utilizes the law of attraction and the natural magnetism of the astral plane to pull this manifestation toward you even more powerfully.<br>
                <br>
                The next plane you navigate with your crystal clear intent, cloaked with its energetic sheath is also in Bardon, but it is not explicit. It is something you may discover through working the exercises diligently.<br>
                <br>
                Through the observation of thoughts, localizing pore breathing and transplanting consciousness, you might come to discover our experiences are encoded in our energetic forms, or the etheric layer. You can also find this through studying Reich or NLP to see it more clearly in Bardon. For example, if you&#39;ve been observing your thoughts closely, you&#39;ll note that the way you think about things that have happened is subtly different from thoughts about things that are going to happen or that have never happened. Most people &quot;represent&quot; these thoughts spatially. When they think of what they ate yesterday, they may note the thought is behind them or to the left. As the events recede further and further into the past they are placed further behind or to the left. When they think of something they know they will be doing tomorrow, it may be close and in front or slightly off to the right. In other disciplines this is called your &quot;timeline.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Using this encoding you can now &quot;place&quot; your energized thought-form in your future energetically, rather than just letting it float as some anomalous blob in a space disconnected with your events. You can also play with other encodings, like where you place things you believe -vs- things you doubt. But the timeline is sufficient alone for this experiment.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, you&#39;ll want some linkage in the material plane. This can be as simple as saying &quot;So mote it be&quot; out loud or writing an affirmation or it could be a ritual or spell that you enact as you unfold the process above. Based on the correlations in the spell or helpful magical implements, this can pull in more sympathetic resonances to enhance the intent. But the ritual alone cannot make up for the missing elements in the core of the practice above. <br>
                <br>
                So these are some thoughts on the subject, hopefully there will be something of use in this long-winded reply.<br>
