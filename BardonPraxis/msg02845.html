<pre>Dear Group

RE: Memories of Franz Bardon

Just over a week ago, I managed to locate a copy of the recently 
published book: Memories of Franz Bardon by Dr Lumir Bardon &amp; Dr M.K.

I seem to remember someone mentioning having read an earlier edition, 
I just wanted to offer my own thoughts on the english version.

In the past year I've been struck by how little reading I manage
to 
get done nowadays, well, this little book I managed to read in one 
session ? and definitely worthwhile. Its thinness defies the 
potential impact of its content.

Though I hold Franz Bardon's IIH system in very high esteem, he
puts 
very little of himself in his three works, besides his general tone 
and manner of writing. His intellect is there, but not the 
personality. Which is all very well, and indeed appropriate, given 
their purpose.

Some have pointed to `Frabato' as offering insight into
Bardon 
himself. I remember being very disenchanted with this piece, more so 
after I had read his main works. It struck me as the literary 
equivalent of a patch-work quilt, and imagining that Bardon wrote it 
himself only served to knock my own estimation of him. So, it was 
with a degree of relief when I later discovered that it was pasted 
together by his secretary, after his death. After which, I was able 
to re-read it without a problem.

Yet still, though `Frabato' is interesting, for me, it failed
to 
offer either any true insight into Bardon, or move me to the extent 
that `Memories' has done so.

`Memories' portrays a very `human' side to a man of
remarkable 
spirituality and abilities. The dedication, the kindness, the 
mistakes, the hardships he endured. Through his son Lumir, and his 
disciple M.K, one can build a picture of a man who lived and breathed 
the essence of Hermetics, helping others in big ways and small, all 
the while fulfilling a divine mission, and indirectly, raising a 
family.

This was something I remember Rawn mentioning somewhere, emphasizing 
that he was still, very human. This book has helped me understand a 
bit more of what Rawn meant by that, on an emotional level, rather 
than just intellectually.

It's one thing to appreciate the value of the IIH system, another
to 
recognise, in some small way, what it took to get it here. I guess 
the greatest tribute to Bardon is to complete the regimen he worked 
so arduously to set out. Nonetheless, the greatest impact this book 
had on me was that I was left with a feeling of immense gratitude 
towards Franz Bardon personally. Not just an intellectual gratitude, 
but a deeply emotional one, which is quite unusual for me.

Besides offering a valuable insight into Franz Bardon himself, it 
offers further additional insights in a variety of other areas, 
dependant in part upon the student's own interests. 

I guess each reader will get something slightly different from the 
book, but I would definitely recommend it. 

Regards

Richard
