<pre>Nice observation Basim. There is a very good explanation of this
phenomenon in Itzhak Bentov?s Stalking the Wild Pendulum. See the
appendix on the physio-kundalini syndrome. He notes this experience in
activities that deal with the ?accelerating evolution of the nervous
system? through either meditative disciplines or, even scarier,
spontaneous occurrences. When your heart beats, blood is pushed out from
the left ventricle, the aorta actually balloons out and creates a strong
pulse that travels down to a point where there is a bifurcation in the
lower abdomen (suspiciously close to the root chakra.) This is the place
where the aorta forks into two to go to the legs. A part of this
pressure rebounds back to the heart. If the heart beats again before
this signal returns, you get the typical rhythmic, but irregular
vibrations that are characteristic of our normal state. This rebound
also sends vibrations up to the head and whacks the underside, a
sensation which we?ve normally tuned out. 

 

Now a curious thing happens when you hold your breath. It sets up a
condition where the heart will not beat again until the signal returns
from the bifurcation point. This creates a very strong resonant sine
wave of around 7Hz, which is an entrainment frequency of the brain right
on the threshold of alpha and theta (as well as being the famous
Schumann resonance, the vibrational frequency of our planet.) The
amplitude of this resonance is about 3x more powerful than our regular
state. Another interesting thing is, this resonance also occurs when the
breath is very still and subtle, a place that most experience meditators
are familiar with.   

 

Itzhak goes into more detail and a fascinating discussion of this
model?s application in understand some of the mechanism of Kunalini and
qi. I highly recommend his book for those curious about more detail.

That's happened to me before - usually right before I fall into a 
full trance state. It's a real, physical sensation, at least for me, 
and again for me it was kind of uncomfortable - I think that, as you 
get closer to trance, you become more aware of these things that you 
don't when you're in a normal, active &quot;I'm watching TV/going to 
work/staying awake in class&quot; state.

As for what it actually is, well - when you're learning archery or 
how to shoot a gun, you're made aware that your entire body vibrates 
when your heart beats, so I've always held that it's just you 
becoming more aware of the echoes. There's probably other 
explanations, but there's mine. Hope this helps.

experience a third beat. It&#xB4;s like a throb but it doesn&#xB4;t come from 
my heart...it&#xB4;s like some pulsating energy mainly focused on my chest 
and abdomen. I don&#xB4;t perceive all the time because I think is motre 
subtle than my respiration or heartbeat.
&gt; Has anybody experience this and know what it is? or I&#xB4;m 
alucinating??
