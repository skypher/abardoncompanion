<pre>My question is at the level of the &quot;blending&quot; of the Fire region 
with the Air region, and, more globally, at the balancing effect of 
the Air Element.

It looks that I face the same problem in all three bodies, 
manifested differently of course.

a) Physical. As mentionned here a few times, strong generation of 
energy (electricity-like) at the Head level. I'm able to disperse 
this energy among my whole body sometimes (which I feel then like 
magnetic pressure or like goose bumps afterwards), but this happens 
more rarely now. And the energy tends to increase with time.
Related to the physical Air region: I also have some problems 
breathing those days (the air is quite dry here, and I can hardly 
cope with it because of a previous illness).
Sending roots into the soil solves partially the issue, but not 
completely. And it even *hurts the sole of my feet* sometimes. Not 
kidding.

b) Astral. Along with the physical sensation, strong emotions or 
even crises of anger. As an example, I was writing the text of my 
little auto-suggestion concerning this topic, and I had to stop 
after a while - couldn't even write anymore.
Digging into those emotions (one-pointedness e.g.) didn't help a lot 
till now, but I'll continue with it.

c) Mental. It looks I have a problem to give form and clothing to my 
creative ideas, which tend to stay at the &quot;essential meaning&quot; level 
(although I clearly feel that &quot;there is something existing inside 
that wants to go out&quot;, particularly at the musical level), but I 
have problems giving them form and &quot;clothing&quot;, as mentionned in the 
Archaeous. It remains unformulated most of the time.

*This* is what keeps me behind schedule, so to speak. I really 
cannot move to level 3 before having solved this. My consolation is 
that *past this step*, this generation of energy may become a boon - 
but not yet :-)

In Archaeous #2 I read, under Air region : &quot;... Here are your 
emotions that communicate your foundational emotions to the outside 
world...&quot;; ok. Those are the Earth and Water-related emotions routed 
through Air. But how are the emotions of my Fire region expressed, 
formulated, and ...dispersed :-) ?

I know this is only a threshold, and that things will go back to 
normal afterwards, but I'd like to move on :-)

Thanks for your patience. I'm embarrassed to always come back with 
the same questions. Please do believe that I try to put the 
suggestions into practice.

NB
