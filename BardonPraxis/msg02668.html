<pre>Dear John,

Aha, thanks for your explanation. I learned a new word. :)

To me, misperceptions would be similar to character traits
in that they stem from ones identities.

Misperceptions:
'I must not watch movies because....' (whatever reason)
'I must not dance because....' 

Character traits:
Lazy because.... (my body must rest)
Shy because... (must be liked by others)

They are all identities that were born at the time where one decided 
that this trait or idea is an appropriate action to accomplish this 
goal. For example, a parent tells his son that his voice is really 
nagging and that he needs to be silent. The boy is shocked that his 
father puts on an angry face, and might from point in time create 
the identity: 'I am a silent person', with the goal 'father must 
like me'.

Practically I see what you mean. It seems difficult to label these 
misperceptions and put them straight into the soul mirror. The 
instruction to stay at home and not to go dancing with ones friends 
(because it is a 'sin'), might reappear in an adult as a fleeting 
'dancing is bad' thought. How does one put that into the mirror. :)

Personally I'd check up on it a bit more before writing it down. 

In my mirror I ended up with a negative 'righteous'; my identity 
that did 'righteous things' and avoided 'sinful things'. The goal 
of that identity was 'must be loved by god'. Obviously, the time
spent being righteous was in the hidden condition 'afraid of god'. 
Being righteous is for many a positive thing, but for me it was a 
negative.

I'm not sure if that is the optimal way to go about the soul 
mirror, but that is how I do it; writing down my identities and 
their goals. Perhaps Rawn can advise?

Related to this example; In my english IIH, Franz Bardon uses 
the label 'registry of sins'. I am a bit curious if that word 
was correctly translated since it isn't a neutral description.

Best regards,
Andreas
