<pre style="margin: 0em;">Rawn,</pre><br>
<tt>Many thanks for your elucidation; it was most helpful. My feeling of 
intense confusion and dilemma seems to have abated (for now!) and I 
attempted the breathing exercise once-more about an hour ago for a 15 
minute period.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Having read your reply (below), I also consulted the correspondence 
links on the Companion site, finding a few key excerpts on Eucharistic 
Magic and the Akasha-Mind connexion, which were most helpful. I think 
some of my difficulty with getting started on this exercise lay in a 
confusion over what I was trying to ask in the first place - that is, 
not simply being unable to accomplish X, but being unaware of what X 
was to start with.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>The notion of EM being Akasha-Mind, yet also a Physical ex. (air as the 
vehicle for ideation, as I believe you phrase it Rawn) is certainly 
revelatory, and indeed clarifies in the permeating nature of Akasha, 
and the interconnectedness / mutual relation between the planes.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I am surrounded by scraps of paper with pencil scrawled all over them - 
I was scribbling away on just prior to posting my planar question ... 
let's just say I can rub out the majority of confusion, which is a 
helpful sign. I am left with more tangible questions, many of which 
need to be answered by myself, no doubt.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>What I noticed from my attempt at conscious breathing originally was 
the difficulty in the ideation itself (which hardly surprises me, I 
might add - it's not exactly something I've done before!). The best way 
I can describe it is my struggle to find the correct 'mode' of thinking 
- I've moved away from the mantric confusion of my first attempt 
(repeating 'health' a lot while breathing!) towards what I see as a 
more 'accurate' approach. Problems with eye strain (thinking of the 
idea being impressed on the air resulting in my eyes wanting to see 
through the lids - still a bit of a problem) seem to have abated 
slightly, and I think I'm touching on the 'right attitude' - momentary 
glimpses of the exercise feeling 'right'. We'll see; as expected, I 
can't rationalise how to do it right, I have to explore practically.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I'm not sure if the above has any questions buried in it or is merely a 
stream of consciousness (apologies either way!) but what I can say for 
sure is that your reply, Rawn (as well as Chuck's most helpful 
clarification on my third question re: vibrations, different forms of 
Akashic emanation not pertaining to 'purity') has certainly helped in 
directing my practical attempts at this Step 1 physical exercise in a 
positive direction.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>So, while no doubt still being quite confused (for example, I had 
another question to pose, but I've conveniently completely forgotten 
it!) I'm very appreciative of the aid that's been given. Many thanks 
again!</tt><br>

<pre style="margin: 0em;">I think your confusion begins with the fact that your ideation is
impressed ...</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">As I wrote above, your ideation impregnates the *Akasha* resident, in
this case, within the physical molecules that compose breathable &quot;air&quot;.
The Akasha permeates *all* things, be they physical, astral and/or
mental. Plus -- and here's the crux of all the Eucharistic magics --
the Akasha readily *absorbs* all the thoughts circulating in the
environment...</pre><br>

understanding the planar analogy. But if we start with an 'Idea', I
don't see why and how (qn 1) this can impregnate the air which then
moves 'up the tree' back to the Spirit again?? This seems circular. &lt;&lt;
...</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Ultimately, there *is* a circular -- or rather, a cyclic -- exchange
between &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot; and between &quot;below&quot; and &quot;above&quot;. This is
how we evolve. :)</pre><br>

<tt>That's not really a very productive way to look at it. An emanation of<br>
*non-sequential essential meaning* by the Akasha, causes a *sequential*<br>
manifestation which continuously multiplies its variations of form 
until<br>
the moment when *all* of the possibilities inherent to the<br>
*non-sequential* Akashic root have been manifest in specific form. At<br>
the physical level, essential meaning reaches its most complex level of<br>
manifestation. This is not &quot;less pure&quot;, but rather &quot;more complex&quot;. It<br>
is still no less an expression of the Akashic root -- no less a part of<br>
that pristine root.</tt><br>

the significance of the Earth Element.<br>

</tt></blockquote></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">of the emanation downward toward the physical. &lt;&lt;</pre><br>
<tt>The Akasha is not &quot;motivated&quot; by a &quot;why&quot;. That is really the purview 
of<br>
human emotion, not the Primum Mobile. Instead of being moved by a<br>
&quot;why&quot;, the Akasha simply *is*. It simply expresses as is its nature to<br>
express. We can however, come to understand the &quot;how&quot; very deeply.<br>
That *is* Hermetics.
