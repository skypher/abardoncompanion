Dear Patrik and all,

 

&gt;&gt;It's very possible that theories from Freud or Jung *could* be very helpful 
&gt;&gt;for introspection (maybe as a second step);&gt;&gt;

 

Yes, for me it has been interesting and quite helpful. 

Before such approach, we need to have already introspected yourself.

When I studied the different neurosis, I saw that it exist a specific character 
(linked with the elements) for each neurosis, I recognise myself in one of 
these.

I?m interested in psychology because I'm currently in a university of 
psychology, and I want to become psychologist. This is only a way as another. 
Not the best maybe, but good for me.

 



 

&gt;&gt;on the other hand, they might also make the whole thing more complicate -as 
&gt;&gt;Rawn once said, you need not read any book, just listen to what the *inner 
&gt;&gt;voice* is saying, where the root cause or the &quot;why&quot; has to be found 
&gt;&gt;andsolved.&gt;&gt;

 

Yes it could complicate things a lot ! We really need to be well involved in 
it, and having a critical eye on it. We also need to understand more deeply 
(than psychoanalysis) the psyche from the Hermetic view. 

 

&gt;&gt;In his answer to Paul Allen, Rawn also mentions, that a magical approach may 
&gt;&gt;be (or is) different or opposite to a psychological approach. This seems very 
&gt;&gt;interesting to me! &gt;&gt;

 

The approach is different, you can characterise the problem/your character with 
an element or a name of a neurosis, (this is the same thing), the rootwith a 
particular moment of your life, and the mechanism with Freud's second topic 
theory.

Bardon?s method of re equilibrium is perfect (level II); I would not use a 
psychoanalysis to solve my problems I think.

 

&gt;&gt;So my question, where do think, from your experience, did you found 
&gt;&gt;psychoanalytical (or psychological) ways to be consistent and helpful, &gt;&gt;

 

I'm not a specialist, but I think that Freud's and Jung's books a good to be 
read, concerning the different point of view of the authors on the mechanisms 
of the ego and the formation of symptoms.

The interpretation of dreams is quite interesting; my unconscious exposed me 
the problem quite clearly one night, I saw the link with the Oedipus of Freud. 
I was astonished ! It really helped me to put my finger on the problem.

You can study the different mechanisms, notions as : repression, interdic, 
oedipus, pulsions, the topics of Freud, the work of the dream, the different 
ways of free speech, symbolisms and unconscious...

 

&gt;&gt;and where do you think them to be opposite to a mere magical approach as 
&gt;&gt;required by Bardons IIH?&gt;&gt;


Jung?s theories are nearer from the esoteric world, but not hermetic. Freud is 
quite grounded; I think this is a quality because we can compare withHermetic. 

I didn?t found an opposition between theses two sciences. Maybe because Iputted 
away the malfunctions, and I stressed out the interesting things ofthese 
theories.

 

I also recommend Eckhart Tolle?s book: ?The Power of Now?, it explainvery 
clearly the ego mechanisms.

 

Fraternally,

Herv&#xE9;
