<pre>Dear Jason,

&gt; However, the final emotional state of terror that commercially
slaughtered animals experience does effect their flesh and as a
consequence does effect the person who eats that flesh. &lt;
&gt;&gt; In what way? Is it the physical body that's affected, or all three?
&lt;&lt;

The meat flesh is affected in two ways. #1) The animal releases large
amounts of adrenaline and probably several other fear-related chemicals
into the blood stream which in turn saturates the flesh. #2) The
emotional energy of fear and resentment is astrally bound to the flesh.
Both of these factors negatively impact the physical and astral bodies
of the person who consumes the flesh, which (since our three bodies are
united) in turn affects the mental body.

&gt; Many folks do find great value in a vegetarian diet in relation to
their spiritual quest. &lt;
&gt;&gt; In what sense? Not having tried Vegetarianism, you've aroused my
intrigue! I might give it a go! :-) &lt;&lt;

I think Pierre and Colin both have answered this question.

&gt;&gt; I'm thinking that the only way to get off the wheel is to redeem all
of one's existing Karma, and - in the process - actually do *nothing*,
so to avoid further attracting negative Karma. This feels like a
circular reference to me, so I'm sure I'm missing something!! ;-) &lt;&lt;

Here's an excerpt from <a  href="../Redemption.html">http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/Redemption.html</a>
that will help explain:

&quot;I said previously that in order to be free from the wheel of
Samsara, the adept must redeem karma the instant that it is created. At
the moment of the adept's physical death, all personal karma must have
been redeemed or reincarnation will ensue. Thus for the adept, the
redemption of karma is a continuous discipline. As each negative effect
is caused, its root lesson is immediately sought out and integrated; and
as each positive effect is caused, its positivity is passed outward and
multiplied throughout the lives of others.
&quot;It is important to note that it is the elimination of ALL
accumulated personal karma -- negative AND positive -- that frees the
individual from Samsara. Negative karma accumulates until we learn its
lesson and change our behavior, but positive karma accumulates when we
hold onto it and do not pass it freely on. Thus the adept gives freely
and without reservation, acting as a conduit for positivity, not as a
source. This is a subtle and important distinction between being a
conduit and a source. When you are a source of positivity, you
accumulate positive karma, but when you are merely a conduit, you do not
accumulate -- you re-deem.&quot;

&gt;&gt; The only solution I can find is this: the attraction of negative
(and, indeed, positive) Karma is more about one's *intent* rather than
one's actions. Is there any validity in this? &lt;&lt;

It's really a combination of the two. Right action, combined with right
intention, generates positive karma. When eating a Big Mac, for
example, having a right intention will diminish, and possibly eliminate,
the negative impact but it will not transform the act into one that
generates positive karma.

&gt;&gt; Which is what I meant by &quot;Eat anything *you* like&quot;. For if one feels
that the killing of an animal is &quot;wrong&quot; (by one's own conscience), then
one may attract negative Karma by killing/eating an animal. However, if
one's conscience is not bothered by such an act, then perhaps
killing/eating *won't* attract negative Karma. &lt;&lt;

No, this is not accurate. This is like saying that if someone murders
another person but doesn't possess the scruples to know it's a wrong
thing to do, then they suffer no karmic consequences. Like I said
earlier, ignoring consequences is not impunity.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
