<pre>Hi Jonathan, 

I have done this eyebright bath and found it to work quite well. You make it 
into a tea suffusion and then add it to pure water in a bowl and immerse the 
eyes as Bardon instructs. The tea is strained in a cheesecloth. One can also 
make a bag with the chessecloth wrapped with string and this saves straining. 
Another way is to soak the concoction with cotton balls and apply to the closed 
eyes while restfully lying down. 

I have also use the eyebright tincture made with alcohol which is only used in 
a pure water drink (a few drops in a glass).

Doing this immediately before the exercises is most beneficial.

I became conscious of the plant spirits helping and being tranferred to me 
through their vibrational imprint in these concoctions

Warm well wishes,

Hi Ben,

I'm not sure about the ratio of herb to water (I've never tried myself),
but will be interested in what people say as I've been thinking about
giving it a go.

However, I would have thought the way of making the eyebath would be to
boil the herb in some water and then strain with cheese cloth or
something similar. I don't think putting a ground up herb in your eye
would do it much good. Please correct me if I'm wrong people!

Cheers,

Jon

Hello Everyone,

I remember this came up before but I tried searching
the archives to see if there was any response. What
strength or ratio do you use eyebright to water for
the strengthening the eyes exercise. Can you use the
dried herb, ground it and put into water??

Any info from anyone thats tried it would be great. 
Sorry If Im repeating an old thread through.

Never been very good with knowing what to do with
herbs and tinctures.

Many Thanks 

Ben
