Rawn
A few questions if i may, just to make sure i have understood this
right ..

you said 
&gt; The process of transformation begins with and hinges upon the Soul
&gt; Mirror *self* analysis of the *present* character. 

also,

&gt; Self-honesty means that *every* valuation you make about your character
&gt; must be based solely upon how *you* *feel* emotionally and what *you*
&gt; *think* about *your own* actions, emotional habits and habits of
&gt; thinking (i.e., your manifest character).

ok. but does this not mean that there is a possibility of our own
&quot;ideals&quot; being out of whack with social/cultural norms ? For eg a
person could think it is &quot;ok&quot; to dominate others for example, because
he (a) &quot;feels&quot; and thinks that it is right (he could have a world
view in which domination of the weaker by the stronger is the &quot;right
thing&quot;)

As a thought experiment let us take someone like say Caesar or Genghis
Khan , who have immense leadership and martial qualities and are
brought up in a culture of conquest(classical Rome or the stepes of
Monglia a particular periods in time).If such a person would do a soul
mirror exercise would he not put down the &quot;ability to dominate others
and bend them to my will&quot; as a *positive* virtue ?and when he
postivizes his soul mirror would he not try to maximise these
qualities ?

On the other hand if a person with such an ability had a &quot;everyone is
equal irrespective of strength&quot; ethic(which would be the case in
modern societies with &quot;equality before law&quot; etc ) the the &quot;will to
dominate&quot; characteristic would be &quot;negative&quot; and something to turn
away from him or use &quot;constructively &quot; (quotes because what
is&quot;constructive&quot; would also vary socially/culturally and situationally) 

&gt;This requires an
&gt; absolute or &quot;radical&quot; honesty with oneself and here is where the
&gt; perennial analogy of the murderer or &quot;black magician&quot; is absurd. 
&gt; By
&gt; definition such an individual would be constitutionally incapable of
&gt; this degree of self-honesty.
&gt; 

&gt; Self-honesty means that *every* valuation you make about your character
&gt; must be based solely upon how *you* *feel* emotionally and what *you*
&gt; *think* about *your own* actions, emotional habits and habits of
&gt; thinking (i.e., your manifest character). 

ok i am confused here . why would someone be unable to look into
himself just because he kills (say, a soldier or a spy) or practices
occultism without understanding all the nuances of what he does (this
would be the meaning of &quot;black magic&quot; from abrdonian pov rght?) and
believes that invoking spirits and making pacts with them is the
*right way* ?

&gt; When you begin interjecting
&gt; what others think or feel or do then you are not reaching all the way
&gt; down to what *you* are thinking or feeling. *Your* thoughts and
&gt; feelings may very well agree with what others *say* they are thinking
&gt; and feeling, and that's perfectly &quot;okay&quot; so long as they are *your*
&gt; feelings and thoughts. And likewise, *your* thoughts and feelings may
&gt; very well disagree with what others *say* they are thinking and feeling,
&gt; and that *also* is perfectly &quot;okay&quot; for *you*, even if no one else
&gt; agrees. *All* that matters in *this* process is what *you* think and
&gt; feel about *you*.

yes my concern here is that by this standard if a person always does
what is right acording to your own &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;thoughts&quot; , he
could still end up doing very destructive things as viewed from the
outside .

Is this still &quot;balanced&quot; ? Is a person whose thoughts emotions and
actions are in harmony balanced if he finds the consequences of his
actions &quot;aceptable&quot; within his examined and accepted world view?


&gt; And of course (I assume this goes without saying but figure I might as
&gt; well say it anyway just to be sure I'm clear enough), the way that our
&gt; actions, thoughts and feelings effect others and our environment are
&gt; important reflections of self that must be considered in any
&gt; self-evaluation. If we feel really great about ourselves but are
&gt; alienating every one around us then something is amiss and way out of
&gt; any sort of *functional* balance. 

considered yes . but the decisions to be taken after that
consideration would still seem to be very uniquely individual and
could range from very &quot;positive&quot; (by a particular set of beliefs) or
&quot;negative&quot; , Are you saying that if the person doing the self analysis
is satisfied emotianally and logicaly about the rightness of his
actions then that is &quot;balanced&quot; ? 


what about if you are alienating some people and gaining the approval
of others ? Do you have to gain the approval of everyone /not
alienbate a single soul in order to be balanced ? just to restate the
point one more time , what if a person feels that a negative behaiour
like killing or domination is a)emotionally &quot;right&quot; b)and logically
&quot;right&quot; as per his world view ?

So would &quot;balance&quot; be culturally dependent ? (i have found a large
part of what seems &quot;right&quot; is very culture dependent .As an extreme
exmple whether one is a &quot;terrorist&quot; &quot;soldier&quot; or &quot;freedom fighter&quot; 
and whether the victims of a terrorist attack/military strike are
&quot;innocent victims&quot; or &quot;collateral damage&quot; would depend very much on
cultural/social assumptions on the rights of the individual, the
nature of war etc .

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated .

Regds, 
NKKA
