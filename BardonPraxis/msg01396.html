<pre>Hi!

&gt; I realise this is highly subjective, but what might the sufferer of
&gt; cancer, for example, infer as their lesson? And how might they know
-
&gt; with accuracy - that they've discovered the *correct* lesson that
&gt; was intended for them? Surely there's considerable guess-work at
&gt; play?

I believe that some lessons could certainly be learned in ways that
would not be remembered in waking consciousness. Then again, I dunno,
I
would personally not call any experience lessons, nor learning, it is 
just the natural order of things.

For spirit to ascend, a re-merge of its separation must occur. This
is 
the result of experience and &quot;lessons&quot;; to see both sides of an issue
a re-merge takes place.

&gt; One can immediately see cause and effect manifest in the Physical
&gt; world (eg, cut my lip, blood appears). Yet I'm unsure how one
&gt; accurately recognises *ethical* Karmic payback.

&gt; To use the obvious example: person A murders person B with a gun.

&gt; There are measurable, physical cause &amp; effect relationships here: a
&gt; trigger is pulled, a bullet it discharged; a bullet penetrates
&gt; person B's body, a hole is created, etc etc etc.

&gt; But there's the *ethical* cause and effect too: Person A has
&gt; commited an act of profound hate &amp; disrespect upon Person B.

At some level I believe that any interaction/communication is a 
cooperation, a co-creation, between Person A and Person B. We have
free will, but these are mutually agreed upon creations. 

Can an experience be somehow &quot;wasted&quot;, without purpose, in this
universe?
My opinion is that everything is connected and of equal importance.

&gt; How might the effect from that *ethical* cause manifest in Person
A's
&gt; life? And how would Person A *know* with certainty (especially an
&gt; incarnation or two later) that the present difficulties in their
life
&gt; are connected back to this act of murder?

Good question, unfortunately I have no good answer. :(

In my opinion, anything we experience is the result of who we are. 
The big things and the small things.

Life appears to be a shock full gallery of opportunities to resolve 
issues and to create new ones. All interactions seem to exist for us
to make the best out of them.

I recently had a nasty toothache, so I went to visit the dentist. I 
got the terrible news that I had many holes in my teeth, because I had
ignored going to the dentist for several years. 

I don't see that fixing my teeth is is a bad situation, even though 
it is painful and costs alot of money. Rather, it is a confirmation 
that I have gained the ability to confront the dentist, and finally
settle this issue of mine. 

Why do I have bad teeth? Nothing happens by chance! lol

Who knows, it might have been haunting me for thousands of years.

My 5 c ramblings

Kindly,
Severian
