Hello Justin,

I hear what you're saying. I don't smoke, but I LOVE coffee and
appreciate it, and at one time I was addicted and needed to have one
(or more). Overcome the need so you can really enjoy it!

I still drink coffee, to ejnoy and appreciate it, but I don't have more
than one a day if I have one at all. If i ever feel I need one, I don't
have it no matter how tired. Perhaps you can do the same thing, smoke
only once a day, or on special occasions? Or change from cigarettes to
a pipe or papers, and make it more ritual like?

I suggest you persist at VOM, emotional distractions can be the loudest
and most challenging to overcome. I suggest you find a solution to your
addiction/enjoyment that you feel happy with and that works, then VOM
will be much easier.


PAUL

&gt; Hello all! Chuck, thx for that wonderful post on the glass of water,
&gt; very nice!
&gt; 
&gt; Ok down to buisness, since i started my soul mirrior work and got a
&gt; problem down (a small one to see the work done and to get a success
&gt; under my belt) now i am working on a bigger issue one that really
&gt; plauges me, nearly every aspect of me at that!
&gt; 
&gt; Good thing is i see the problem bad thing is that don't fix it:)
&gt; See i really, REALLY enjoy smoking, however i am addicted to it, well
&gt; to be more accurate the addiction takes smoking as its ambassador,
&gt; when i quit smoking i get addicted to coffee so its not just smoking
&gt; i know, and i have those issues mapped out and i am working on them.
&gt; The conflict comes in with my enjoyment of it (smoking/coffee just as
&gt; the outward show of problem and to simplify this post) meets my will
&gt; to quit. 
&gt; 
&gt; I know i am addicted and its no good for my health, as well as my
&gt; wife hates the smell of smoke and my child can't and shouldn't be
&gt; around it. However i absoluetly love smoking (i believe i said that
&gt; earlier:)) This conflict within myself has caused me a great fallback
&gt; in VOM, i cant go 5 min without a distraction now :( I have also
&gt; noticed problems spring up elsewhere put i am able to keep it mostly
&gt; under control.I feel as if my addiction has declared war on my
&gt; Hermetic path since im trying to root it out (sorry for the
&gt; externalization of the problem but i felt thats the best way to
&gt; explain it.)
&gt; 
&gt; Should i put VOM on hold? would this be OK? what if after i finish
&gt; this problem i still can't focus on VOM. I have no problem focusing
&gt; any other time just during VOM.I feel if i put it on hold i will be
&gt; behind; however this inability to do VOM is frustrating!
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to once again post my problems, and sorry for the mess i call
&gt; this message :)
&gt; 
&gt; I guess all i need is to see if this has happened to others and
&gt; possible ways to remedy the problem if it has. Its a strange feeling
&gt; to desire something as well as want to rid yourself of said
&gt; thing....hmmn.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh and by the way this is Draco i just got rid of the name because i
&gt; felt my time with it passed.And yes that is my real name :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;
