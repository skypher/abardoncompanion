<pre>Hello Scott:

Do we make unconscious choices? I would think &quot;choice&quot; would be a conscious 
endeavor.

Hi everyone,

I wanted to add a few thoughts on free will.

There is only one happening, and this happening has always been the same 
happening and this happening 'has' occured but once. 

There is nothing 'outside' of this happening. 

Life is the passing through in~temporality~process by which consciousness is 
acquiring, did acquire and will acquire the understanding it is infinite and 
this process is a bound up whole.

All of the reflected selves of which you and I are one each, ''wills''. Each 
reflected self wills and this changes moment by moment what the unity IS. The 
unity is never the same ( in time ), yet it is always naturally what it IS. 

IT does not have to TRY to BE because IT IS, with a capital I and S.

Also, the unity does not sit back behind manifest phenomenon, IT IS the 
manifest phenomenon, ALL OF IT.

''To'' a reflected self the unity does something through a someone, ''to'' the 
unity nothing is done through no-one.

The reflected selves are right 'in the middle of it', the unity; we are 
co-operating or co-creating, we are THAT, when you will or think you create 
from the highest level of mind downward and quite literally change the entire 
universe. 

Without you I do not exist, without me you do not exist. Each self is 
reflecting the unitive consciousness of all that is through itself and this 
unitive consciousness includes each and every other reflected self.

Imagine a tape like a video tape which contains upon it every thing that could 
possibly happen, will happen and has happened.

The ONE movie;

Everything that can be done, will be done, or has been done has 'already' been 
done. 

Everything that can be done, will be done or has been done is also in the 
process of *BECOMING* even though it has already BEEN done. 

The box office is closed and there are no new or different movies being run, 
there is only the ONE ( movie ) which encompasses ALL.
The one movie is all the things that can be done, will be done, or have been 
done; there is no movie other than this movie. Not only is the box office 
closed, there was only one movie choice to begin with! 

Then there are those things that participate in the movie i.e 'you' and 'me'; 
the things that make the movie what it is, the contents, all of life you see 
around you. And there is the movie itself; but there is always and ever only 
the one. 

The movie itself is on a reel of tape enclosed in a sealed container, and is in 
the process of BECOMING 'when' it runs. 

'''When''' it runs we call this the temporal space time continuum. 
'''When''' it is sealed up as a whole, where the one movie is all, everything 
at once, we call this eternal infinite now.

WE ARE the tape being played out *live* right now. We are the contents, the 
pictures on the tape, we are what makes the movie ( unity ) what it is.

When we will the unity is functioning / moving and all these infinite wills of 
everything is making the unity what it IS moment by moment LIVE right now.

Again, there is only one happening, and this happening has always been the same 
happening and this happening has 'occured' but once. There is nothing 'outside' 
of this happening.

Rawn mentioned that the will is the POWER to choose, and I believe it is 
important to highlight the word power because any choice you make is fully 
encompassed and always was. Yet it is this POWER to choose that we call free 
will.

No matter what your choice it is fully encompassed by the one bound up whole of 
now. We pass~through and particularize particular nows!
Like this particular now right NOW!

As time bound humans we do as we must and consider what our destiny is; 

We share the same destiny as everyTHING; To go from 'ourselves' REFLECTING all 
that is to 'ourselves' BEING all that is. 

Or to put it another way;

*SELF reflects ITSELF and realizes ITSELF as ITSELF*,

Yet EACH REFLECTED SELF has a COMPLETE exclusive viewpoint that no other self 
has as that unique reflected self, yet when self realizes itself as SELF it is 
ALL. 

The wonderful paradox that isn't, and the hidden beauty of what we call will is 
the peculiarity of trying to express in the nature of words the following;

The fact that EVERY self has complete free reign to express itself in whatever 
way it wishes yet whatever way it wishes was 'meant to be', or that whatever 
way it wishes, WILL BE, YET always WAS.

Kind Regards,

Scott.
