Dear Rawn,

As you run this group, you are well aware that an incredible number of
the trainee magi *are* impressionable and furthermore many have
difficulty understanding and comprehending many *simple* instructions
of magical training.

When you state that *you* as the leader of this group have a postive
experince of what is ultimately and *unquestionably* a neagtive vice
you are opening the floodgates and acting irresponsibly.

I am not speaking to you borne of ego, but of concern as this is one
of an incredibly few posts you have made which is not constructive.

When I tell people what they *need* to do, it is a contractual
obligation - nobody can claim that they are stuck at a lower
vibrational resting rate for a *very* long time after death when they
have been directly warned about action which needs to be undertaken.
The discord on the other side for this reason is *massive*.

Your comment regarding the underlying meaning of messages and the fact
that many are simply as they seem is borne of the fact that you are
not able to see this deeply in to the reality of the situation. Have
you perchance considered that your smoking is symbolic of the clouding
of the intellect to a sufficient degree that prevents you from
penetrating truth this deeply and subsequently use your present
konwledge as a smokescreen to remain in a comfort zone?

As always, I love your forum and find it incredibly constructive and
beneficial to the members; but pretending something negative is OK as
that is your perception of the experince is *not* constructive in your
position.

&gt;From your perspective, I am just a random name on a screen - and
indeed I am; but remember that when you come to rest; the previously
stated contractual obligation on my part has been fulfilled.

Regards,

Mark

&gt; Dear Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; It is important to note that often the underlying will of the *All*
&gt; is present in ways the author of a note/article/book/song etc. is often
&gt; never aware of, and the underlying meaning can only be unlocked by those
&gt; gifted with sufficient insight and development. The underlying intent
&gt; of the post was for the author to be made aware that smoking is not
&gt; healthy and to have a self created veil lifted with which he can
&gt; subsequently work. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; :) And just as often a message is exactly what it appears. Many times,
&gt; the assumption that there is a) something underlying and b) that you
&gt; know exactly what it is, leaves the primary question unanswered. At
&gt; that point, the response becomes about the responder and not the
&gt; question.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Interestingly you state you have a physcial addiction, but have
&gt; sorted out the emtional level of your problem. This still doesn't change
&gt; the fact you have a physical and negative addiction, which you need to
&gt; balance out with healing remedies and magic. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Egotism is an interesting beast, especially as it manifests in those
&gt; pursuing a magical initiation. I've lost count of the number of
&gt; messages to BardonPraxis I've rejected because they had to do with
&gt; nothing other than the author's own ego needs to impress others!
&gt; Frequently this is manifested as a person telling another person what
&gt; they &quot;need&quot; to do in order to make themselves a better person, better
&gt; magician, etc. And most often, these assertions are based upon
&gt; erroneous assumptions colored by the author's own internal struggles.
&gt; Or even when the assumptions are correct, there is still the author's
&gt; own need to give directions where they have no business giving them.
&gt; 
&gt; Frankly, while you are welcome to your opinions about me and about
&gt; smoking, you are not welcome to tell me what I &quot;need&quot; to do. *I* decide
&gt; what *I* need do. That is the essence of the Soul Mirror work of
&gt; character transformation -- that we each must consciously decide what
&gt; *we* are to do or not do based upon *our own* understanding of
&gt; ourselves. A related lesson that *hopefully* arises during the
&gt; experience of the Soul Mirror work is that it is none of *our* business
&gt; what others choose -- that is *their* choice and *their* responsibility,
&gt; just as *our* choices are *ours*.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Occasional smoking can indeed be useful as a stimulant for certain
&gt; activities, but claiming that a consitent phsyical addiction (and your
&gt; wonderful yellow teeth!) is not negative &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; ;-) It is always interesting to me to see what parts of my statements
&gt; folks will completely overlook in their rush to react to those parts of
&gt; my words that strike some sort of internal chord. It reveals a lot
&gt; about where they are coming from and what issues are most prevalent for
&gt; them. For the record, I did not claim that smoking or any part of it,
&gt; was &quot;not negative&quot;. I repeatedly emphasized the fact that I was
&gt; speaking about *my* experience. To quote --
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;So for *me*, it is not a negative experience. I *enjoy* smoking and
&gt; for *me* the benefits *I* reap from the experience far outweigh any
&gt; physical detriment.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; puts out a highly incorrect and negative message to the more
&gt; impressopnable and less strongly willed. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; *My* message, regardless of how you have interpreted it, was in response
&gt; to a question about *my* experience with smoking and I answered speaking
&gt; only for *my*self. It was *completely* correct for *me* as a statement
&gt; of *my* experience.
&gt; 
&gt; Besides, the members of this list are intelligent enough to actually
&gt; think for themselves! :)
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
