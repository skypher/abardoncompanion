<tt>Hi. It has been my experience that VOM was simple (not easy) once one 
stopped seeking it to manifest (proverbially, &quot;one cannot dance when one is 
watching that one is dancing.&quot;) .. and instead, just == LET MYSELF == &quot;BE&quot; 
there. In essence, I stopped looking for myself being there and WAS there, 
instead.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I stopped reflecting upon myself. I surrendered to BEING ... which never 
requires &quot;reflection - of - myself - to - myself - to - verify - myself - 
exisitng - as - myself &quot; ...(etc).</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Ex.</pre><br>
<tt>When one feels most filled with joy in physical life, once that joy is 
STEPPED OUT OF to REFLECT upon its reality or instensity of expereince (self 
validation, etc.) , does that not trip one out of the full depth expereince?</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>When one starts to reflect or analyze or question a dream experience as one 
enters it from wakefullness into sleep, does not one then snap back to a NON 
dream state?</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I think it is a higher order reflection of these. As above, so below. Same 
toolset, different work benches, so to speak.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>VOM, seems to be a state of BEING rather than a state of REFLECTION on 
BEING. THere is a wonderous experience of resting and really not having to 
GO DO something or create some phenomenon, etc.</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Thanks.

<pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>Dear Rawn and fellow group members,</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">This morning whilst meditating with the intention of achieving
Vacancy of Mind, I first passively observed my thoughts for a few
minutes and then focussed as intensely as I could upon one single
question for a further few minutes. Suddenly, instead of striving to
empty my mind as I have done previously, I felt a sudden surge of
energy fill my body and mind instantly - it is difficult to explain
but it was very intense, but at the same time not really distracting
(I can't really communite that concept properly with words), and
then it was as if Vacancy of Mind filled me rather than me striving
for it... if that makes any sense to anybody. I think I achieved VoM
for several minutes, perhaps even five minutes, but I can imporve on
it because there were still shadows of thoughts once in a while
(although they were easily dismissed).</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Is this surge of energy something to be ignored? I felt that I had
to concentrate at first on relaxing my body because I was resisting
it and becoming a little tense.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">After the meditation, I felt extremely joyful and still. I felt that
everything around me (even the wallpaper) was alive and almost a
part of me.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Rawn, what is the best way to build on this during future
meditations? Am I on the right track or being distracted by
irrelevant occurrences? Any advice would be appreciated.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Good will to everyone!</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Martin</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;"><br></pre><br>
