TABE,


I was a baby the first two or three times and 13 years old when I first started 
having continuous contact with beings from the other realm, but I had made a 
few enemies before this life and experienced many attacks during my teenage 
years up to about 20 years of age and a few ever since.

I have found that good is flanked/paralleled by evil and when you have one you 
are close to the other, but it can be balanced.

Now at 54 years of age I am still busy and am involved in matters that make me 
a desirable foe or target and so I can still have spiritual attacks no 
different then our beloved brother Franz Bardon.

For example I (recently) helped another person thwart off some evil sorcery 
that was put on them and I too was attacked for helping them and so the war 
goes on.

I like to help them help themselves with knowledge so they do not need me or 
become co-dependent and hopefully so they can pass it on to others.

I do wish that more folks were desirous of the Franz Bardon material as it can 
help them immensely. I do not consider myself a master at this time, but a 
student.

I only discovered Franz Bardon in the last 2 years or less and am still 
studding his material, but it is slower learning then I like.

So much to learn, so little learned and so little time to learn it in. I hope I 
can get all my children raised and continuously learn and become a Master. 

How I distinguish between the negative beings and the light ones was not always 
easy and I have been tricked a few times.

I find that beings from the astral realm (spirit world) are not a lot different 
from the ones here in that they are on many different levels of evolution.

Any information that I receive from persons in the flesh or spirit (energy 
form) I evaluate the same and if it is sound, wise, functional/workable 
knowledge then I consider and or use it.

I have met a few real Masters in this life and they have given me some good 
council and knowledge, but I have to do it! 

I looked up Franz Bardon's Maya Astrology and he is 11 Kawoq.

Kawoq's are social people, community type and are here to help the 
group/people. Number 11 in the Maya is a number of Karma, trials and many 
mental, emotional and spiritual tests.

I am 11 Tooj and have a different energy then Franz Bardon, but I am a number 
11 and so share that in common with him.

Am sending you an attachment of something I wrote on the Maya Destiny Quest.

Sincerely, Robert



Robert, How old were you? I will like to hear more
about your story, and your route to mastership. How
did you distinguish between the negative and positive
beings. How and at what age did you discover master
Bardon's works?

Light, Life, Love.

&gt; Magical Evocation has been a long time interest of
&gt; mine since I was a child I have had many experiences
&gt; with beings from other realms, but when young it was
&gt; often frightening, because some of them were
&gt; negative and attempted to invoke and (at the time) I
&gt; did not know well how to deal with them.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Finally I was able to mostly evade contact with
&gt; these beings from other realms for a while, but when
&gt; older I eventually realized I needed to learn more
&gt; about this area (penetrating into my life) and so
&gt; (being Native American &amp; Anglo mixed and of Mormon
&gt; descent) I did some study into Mayan/Toltec type of
&gt; evocation with fair success and then the Kabbalah,
&gt; Zohar and other related books that Joseph Smith
&gt; (Founder of Mormonism) studied, like 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;The Magus&quot; by Frances Barrett &quot;Astrology Restored&quot;
&gt; By Ramsey and a few others related books He had
&gt; read.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Before I knew of Franz Bardon and his books I made
&gt; Seals, Magical Squares &amp; pentacles of some of the
&gt; planets (from&quot;The Keys of Solomon&quot;) and had some
&gt; success at evocation, but both negative and positive
&gt; beings came.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Some day I will write down my experiences in this
&gt; area if it can help others.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Now I see that Franz Bardon lays it out in a good
&gt; way. Having studied and practiced Toltec/Mayan &amp;
&gt; Kabbalah first it sometimes has been difficult for
&gt; me to do all the steps in order, (as per Bardon) but
&gt; when I am in over my head, I find that I am not
&gt; clear in one of the important steps so I return to
&gt; 
&gt; I. I .H.
