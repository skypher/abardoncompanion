<pre>My friend, from what I have read you *always* have a useful reply.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Some thoughts on manifestation...
&gt;
&gt;It's a weird thing about Bardon. I've found myself, in the past, going
&gt;off on tangents to Bardon and exploring all sorts of sundry techniques
&gt;and more immediately seductive byways of magic and enchantment. And,
&gt;after these long loops, I find myself back to discover the essence of my
&gt;new experience was actually distilled in some form or another in
&gt;Bardon's IIH. The reason I didn't seen it, at first, was that in his
&gt;written form it is sometimes difficult to pick out where the emphasis
&gt;should be. Or he will mention something seemingly in passing that is a
&gt;critical distinction in the effectiveness of a technique or practice.
&gt;Some of these distinctions, especially for manifestation, are packed
&gt;into the first two steps.
&gt;
&gt;The model of magical manifestation, as I work with it to date, deals
&gt;with bringing a form down through 4 layers into the physical. The
&gt;shifting from one layer to the next needs to be smooth an integral... a
&gt;martial arts example is &quot;punching with your feet.&quot; Force is transmitted
&gt;through the linking your entire body into one fluid and coordinated
&gt;movement.
&gt;
&gt;In manifestation, I believe this movement must start *well* in the
&gt;mental. This can mean a couple of things.
&gt;
&gt;1. Clear outcome. You have to know what it is, specifically, that you
&gt;want so your intent is not ambiguous or ill-defined. If you can't see
&gt;this clearly in your imagination you cannot coalesce a structure for the
&gt;energy to manifest materially.
&gt;2. Your thought-form needs to be strong, not a nebulous wish. Strong has
&gt;some very quantitative measures. For example... you should be able to
&gt;hold this intent for at least 17 seconds for it to have the slimmest
&gt;chance of making it any further than just a random thread which is the
&gt;typical nature of most everyday thinking. Strength also pertains to how
&gt;vivid you can make this thought form.
&gt;
&gt;Once you have a finely honed thought-form, which is actually the
&gt;building blocks of exercises in step 1 and 2 you need to link it to
&gt;energy. Energy as a property of the astral and the emotions -vs- the
&gt;mental plane.
&gt;
&gt;Here it's easy to make a mistake, even if you created the thought-form
&gt;impeccably and have collected the typically nebulous, diffused energy of
&gt;the tick-tock mind into a focused, compact intent of magical volition.
&gt;
&gt;There's a tendency for us to think &quot;about&quot; something or to think &quot;of&quot;
&gt;something -vs- a more powerful way of forming this directional energy on
&gt;the astral, Neville captures this distinction in his excellent book
&gt;&quot;Awakened Imagination&quot; as follows:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;...we must use imagination masterfully, not as an onlooker thinking
&gt;*of* the end, but as a partaker thinking *from* the end. We must
&gt;actually *be* there in imagination. If we do this, our subjective
&gt;experience will be realized objectively.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Of course, this is stated in Bardon more succinctly with his advice to
&gt;use impregnation as-if you already contained the quality you seek.
&gt;
&gt;The key is to invoke this energy with the feeling of you already having
&gt;accomplished your goal and experiencing now how it will feel &quot;then.&quot; You
&gt;may often discover, in this step, that it is not really or exactly what
&gt;you wanted, and you'll need to go back to work again on clarifying your
&gt;intent. This usually indicates parts of yourself that are not aligned
&gt;with your goal and that would have ultimately sabotaged your intent.
&gt;
&gt;I believe this also utilizes the law of attraction and the natural
&gt;magnetism of the astral plane to pull this manifestation toward you even
&gt;more powerfully.
&gt;
&gt;The next plane you navigate with your crystal clear intent, cloaked with
&gt;its energetic sheath is also in Bardon, but it is not explicit. It is
&gt;something you may discover through working the exercises diligently.
&gt;
&gt;Through the observation of thoughts, localizing pore breathing and
&gt;transplanting consciousness, you might come to discover our experiences
&gt;are encoded in our energetic forms, or the etheric layer. You can also
&gt;find this through studying Reich or NLP to see it more clearly in
&gt;Bardon. For example, if you've been observing your thoughts closely,
&gt;you'll note that the way you think about things that have happened is
&gt;subtly different from thoughts about things that are going to happen or
&gt;that have never happened. Most people &quot;represent&quot; these thoughts
&gt;spatially. When they think of what they ate yesterday, they may note the
&gt;thought is behind them or to the left. As the events recede further and
&gt;further into the past they are placed further behind or to the left.
&gt;When they think of something they know they will be doing tomorrow, it
&gt;may be close and in front or slightly off to the right. In other
&gt;disciplines this is called your &quot;timeline.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Using this encoding you can now &quot;place&quot; your energized thought-form in
&gt;your future energetically, rather than just letting it float as some
&gt;anomalous blob in a space disconnected with your events. You can also
&gt;play with other encodings, like where you place things you believe -vs-
&gt;things you doubt. But the timeline is sufficient alone for this
&gt;experiment.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, you'll want some linkage in the material plane. This can be as
&gt;simple as saying &quot;So mote it be&quot; out loud or writing an affirmation or
&gt;it could be a ritual or spell that you enact as you unfold the process
&gt;above. Based on the correlations in the spell or helpful magical
&gt;implements, this can pull in more sympathetic resonances to enhance the
&gt;intent. But the ritual alone cannot make up for the missing elements in
&gt;the core of the practice above.
&gt;
&gt;So these are some thoughts on the subject, hopefully there will be
&gt;something of use in this long-winded reply.
