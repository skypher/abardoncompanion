There are many possibilities when dealing with spiritual occurrences, but 
mostly the average person is relatively ignorant of spiritual phenomena and 
does not understand what is going on or much less how to deal with it.
IIH does well at revealing the basics of this and putting it in perspective.

I'm not too sure if this is true. For example, what
happens when Kundalini awakens early and someone is
not ready for it. This can be dangerous.

Or when a neophyte successfully summons an elemental,
the elemental sees an extreme elemental imbalance and
decides to attack the operator. 

Sometimes I think it is a wise idea to not encourage
spiritual awakenings unless the how and why are fully
comprehended. This is only my opinion. The magician
must learn through his own experience in the end
though.

Sincerely,
Allen Kray

&gt; Hello Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; Are these particles a sort of transluscent white?
&gt; I
&gt; met a Chi Gung master from China once. He
&gt; explained
&gt; something similar when he was accessing the akasha
&gt; for
&gt; information concerning people he would heal. I
&gt; didn't
&gt; get the impression he saw these particles of
&gt; information constantly though.
&gt; 
&gt; The color part of your experiences reminds me a
&gt; bit of
&gt; the Pranic Healing visualizations from Choa Kok
&gt; Sui.
&gt; Other than that, I'm at a loss.
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder what you might experience if you were to
&gt; practice tattwa card exercises. Some tattwa card
&gt; meditations will highten your sensitivity to gaze
&gt; directly into the akasha - ether. Though, I don't
&gt; know
&gt; the drawbacks to this. Seems like you would be
&gt; skipping steps of IIH and possibly developing
&gt; parts of
&gt; yourself you may not be ready to appropriately
&gt; control.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Allen Kray

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a query regarding ether and some
&gt; associated
&gt; &gt; phenomenon I have 
&gt; &gt; beenexperiencing for some time now.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I recently found out that the kind of specky
&gt; opaque
&gt; &gt; shiny energy 
&gt; &gt; field / particles everywhere are the &quot;ether&quot;; I
&gt; had
&gt; &gt; assumed 
&gt; &gt; previously that this stuff was the Akasa. This
&gt; seems
&gt; &gt; to be the case, 
&gt; &gt; can anyone verify this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Being able to see this is a permanent satte, it
&gt; does
&gt; &gt; not interfere 
&gt; &gt; with physical sight but is nonetheless present
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; all times. Is this 
&gt; &gt; a sort of &quot;basic&quot; sight of the astral dimension
&gt; &gt; whilst on the 
&gt; &gt; physical plane; i.e. with actual training will
&gt; it be
&gt; &gt; possible to 
&gt; &gt; physically tune in to the astral realm in a
&gt; waking
&gt; &gt; state, as at 
&gt; &gt; certain times and after certain meditations I
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; see stuff moving 
&gt; &gt; in it whilst physically very awake.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When performing EOM meditatinos or doing the
&gt; &gt; half-hour non-moving 
&gt; &gt; physical asana and doing EOM at the same time th
&gt; &gt; akasa / ether 
&gt; &gt; (still visible with eyes closed as when eyes
&gt; open)
&gt; &gt; turns in to sort 
&gt; &gt; of live energy fields, swirling like a parabola;
&gt; &gt; which with 
&gt; &gt; concentratino can go through phases from the
&gt; base
&gt; &gt; lilac / purple 
&gt; &gt; through to white and gold; is this a separate
&gt; energy
&gt; &gt; filed that the 
&gt; &gt; exercise enables you to tap in to, or is it the
&gt; &gt; actual akasa / ether 
&gt; &gt; forming in relation to the environment you
&gt; created.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm very vague about this stuff as very little
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; been written on 
&gt; &gt; it, but the phenomenon has been very permanent
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; some time. Also, 
&gt; &gt; how should I expect this to develop - its been
&gt; &gt; around for a long 
&gt; &gt; while, but I have only recently found out that
&gt; it's
&gt; &gt; not that normal, 
&gt; &gt; even in esoteric circles. How does it relate to
&gt; &gt; Bardonian 
&gt; &gt; development?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Many thanks,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mark
