<pre> Yes I do understand not going too far ahead when one is in IIH however it must 
also be realized that when something more advanced comes up then one is ready 
for it.

Hello Mark,

Are these particles a sort of transluscent white? I
met a Chi Gung master from China once. He explained
something similar when he was accessing the akasha for
information concerning people he would heal. I didn't
get the impression he saw these particles of
information constantly though.

The color part of your experiences reminds me a bit of
the Pranic Healing visualizations from Choa Kok Sui.
Other than that, I'm at a loss.

I wonder what you might experience if you were to
practice tattwa card exercises. Some tattwa card
meditations will highten your sensitivity to gaze
directly into the akasha - ether. Though, I don't know
the drawbacks to this. Seems like you would be
skipping steps of IIH and possibly developing parts of
yourself you may not be ready to appropriately
control.

Sincerely,
Allen Kray

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a query regarding ether and some associated
&gt; phenomenon I have 
&gt; beenexperiencing for some time now.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently found out that the kind of specky opaque
&gt; shiny energy 
&gt; field / particles everywhere are the &quot;ether&quot;; I had
&gt; assumed 
&gt; previously that this stuff was the Akasa. This seems
&gt; to be the case, 
&gt; can anyone verify this.
&gt; 
&gt; Being able to see this is a permanent satte, it does
&gt; not interfere 
&gt; with physical sight but is nonetheless present at
&gt; all times. Is this 
&gt; a sort of &quot;basic&quot; sight of the astral dimension
&gt; whilst on the 
&gt; physical plane; i.e. with actual training will it be
&gt; possible to 
&gt; physically tune in to the astral realm in a waking
&gt; state, as at 
&gt; certain times and after certain meditations I can
&gt; see stuff moving 
&gt; in it whilst physically very awake.
&gt; 
&gt; When performing EOM meditatinos or doing the
&gt; half-hour non-moving 
&gt; physical asana and doing EOM at the same time th
&gt; akasa / ether 
&gt; (still visible with eyes closed as when eyes open)
&gt; turns in to sort 
&gt; of live energy fields, swirling like a parabola;
&gt; which with 
&gt; concentratino can go through phases from the base
&gt; lilac / purple 
&gt; through to white and gold; is this a separate energy
&gt; filed that the 
&gt; exercise enables you to tap in to, or is it the
&gt; actual akasa / ether 
&gt; forming in relation to the environment you created.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm very vague about this stuff as very little has
&gt; been written on 
&gt; it, but the phenomenon has been very permanent for
&gt; some time. Also, 
&gt; how should I expect this to develop - its been
&gt; around for a long 
&gt; while, but I have only recently found out that it's
&gt; not that normal, 
&gt; even in esoteric circles. How does it relate to
&gt; Bardonian 
&gt; development?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Mark
&gt; 
&gt;
