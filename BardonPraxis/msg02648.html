<pre>Hi Chris

No true initiate will force a student to do anything, they're there
to guide and advise, any form of coercion falls far short of spiritual
practice in my view.

Sounds more like a karmic issue of dealing with confrontation
rather than seeking a solution through Bardon, and all karmic issues
are terrible complex and very personal.

The motto I tend to live by is: &quot;reconciliation, not retaliation&quot;
If this doesn't work then I remove myself from that environment,
there are exceptions, but bear in mind that any retaliation will 
only create negative karma for yourself. Is this what you want?

I can only offer an opinion, and nothing in terms of wisdom, but don't be
drawn into actions that you wouldn't have entertained on your own.

R

Subject: [BardonPraxis] hermetics and confrontation


I've been a student of bardon... kind of on and off for about a year 
and a half now.... and it tends to dwell on personal growth and the 
like.... but I've been studying magic in general, mostly heart-
chakra type activities under a teacher..... recently we've had 
a..... falling out of sorts, because I didn't bend to his will the 
way he wanted me to...... and anyway... I have a strong feeling that 
some bad things will soon fall upon him or rather his plans will 
fall apart, and he is going to blame me directly for it and a 
confrontation will be inevitable...... since our falling out I 
decided convert to strictly hermetic studies because it has 
interested me since I first learned of bardon...... and I was 
wondering what the hermetic view is on confrontations and what 
should be done about them and during them when they come up....... 
it's a long story what caused this chain of events and I don't wish 
to bore you with the details, but I'm just wanting to know what I 
(as a student of hermetics) should do, supposing this confrontation 
occurs as I believe it will... any advice and/or suggestions would 
be welcomed...... I intend to work ferverously through IIH (starting 
again from scratch) in order to strengthen my position in the 
situation, but if there's any other tips someone can give me on how 
to deal with it I would greatly appreciate it... I believe I will 
have about 2 or 3 months to prepare, so if there's any outside IIH 
sources that anyone knows about that I should study/meditate on that 
would be beneficial to me as well...... thanks

Chris
