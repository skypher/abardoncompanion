Hi..
I didn&#xB4;t woke up one morning and possess completely the quality that 
I was working on.
The changes happened with time, gradually, with a lot of work, 
patience, and dedication.
The eucharistic method of food blessing for example, Bardon states 
that this method has a stronger effect in physical wishs, concerning 
your physical body. If you wish for example that your patience 
develops, it is a wish concerning mental and astral bodies, so, the 
effect is not as powerful as if you were working with a physical wish.
The use of auto-suggestion, plus food blessing, plus breathing 
exercise, plus a continuous instrospetion every day, plus water 
magic, plus a conscious developed enough to pay attention in your 
behave during the day(this is an habit that must be incorporated 
during the mental instruction of step 1), and working with one 
problem at a time, you certainly will achieve your objective, sooner 
or later.
Yours,

Joel

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been working with IIH for 3.5 years now. In that time - in my
&gt; work with the Soul Mirror tools - I've not experienced character
&gt; changes in the way that Bardon describes.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I can certainly use my *will* to effect change, but the
&gt; eucharistic magics seem to have no effect upon me.
&gt; 
&gt; I was hoping other folks here would be willing to share their
&gt; experience of eucharistic-based character change: what was it 
like?  
&gt; 
&gt; Did you wake up one morning and suddenly possess the quality that
&gt; you'd been working towards?  
&gt; 
&gt; Did it come on gradually - perhaps with an occasional slide back - 
and
&gt; then fully integrate into your character?  
&gt; 
&gt; Did you need to actively engage your will in the process, and 
perhaps
&gt; some auto-suggestion?  
&gt; 
&gt; Did events, circumstances and &quot;things&quot; around you begin to alter 
too,
&gt; seemingly in support of your own change?
&gt; 
&gt; Someone here recently suggested that when the eucharistic magics 
work,
&gt; they do so because of a &quot;placebo&quot; effect. That is, if one
&gt; impregnates *someone else's* food/water/air with a thought, that
&gt; person gets no benefit. Inversely, it works only when one
&gt; *consciously* consumes the substance that's been impregnated *by
&gt; oneself*.  
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, it only works if you *believe* in it.
&gt; 
&gt; However, Rawn is emphatic: we are impressing an idea upon the 
Akasha
&gt; resident in the substance, and it's *actually* altering our mental 
and
&gt; astral bodies.....whether we believe it or not.
&gt; 
&gt; Given that I (sadly) have no personal evidence to support that, I'm
&gt; curious to hear of others' discoveries.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you kindly,
&gt; 
&gt; Jason Paris
