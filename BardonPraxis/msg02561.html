<pre>Dear Joa,

There's a fine internal line between defending yourself and your loved
ones, and getting back at someone who has hurt you. At the core of the
difference is emotional motivation. Reacting out of fear and spite or
to seek revenge, is all about how hurt or afraid *you* feel and has
nothing to do with actual defense or protection. Nor does it have
anything to do with *magic*. In order to perform *magic*, you must step
back from emotional motivation. Granted, emotional investment plays a
part in the power of one's magical effectiveness but only as a *tool*,
not as a core motivation. A true magician is in *command of* their
emotions, not ruled *by* them.

I've had the opportunity to speak and work with several folks who have
been the subject of genuine &quot;psychic attacks&quot; and not a single one of
them had any success by *fighting* their oppressors on the same level at
which their attackers were working. They only succeeded when they
*protected themselves* through the application of higher forms of magic.

And in my own life, when I come under this sort of attack, I never
&quot;fight back&quot; or seek to in any way take revenge through harming the
attacker. Personally, I don't *care* if they learn a lesson or suffer
because of their actions against me. I simply protect myself and
diffuse my attacker. In this way, the attacker is disempowered;
whereas, responding in kind *only* empowers them. That is the nature of
attack -- it thrives upon receiving the fear reaction from its victim.
If the victim refuses to be a victim and does not reply in kind with a
negative action, then the attacker gains nothing and has, in fact, lost
energy.

While personal ethics play a role here, the main issue is what actually
works when you're confronted with an attack. :) For example, if some
one is attacking you with a knife, then obviously you want to disable
them in whatever way you are able. But going further and then trying to
kill them because they had the gall to attack you is another matter
entirely and this is where personal ethics come into play. Defending
yourself is an instinctual necessity but taking revenge is an
emotionally motivated *choice*.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
