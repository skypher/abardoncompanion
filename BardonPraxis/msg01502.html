Guide for Autumn 2003

Dear Praxis,

Here is my second guide dog for your practice. I hope the first one was
of use to you, and that I will be able to continue to write these
letters to you all in the future. This season I have included a few
solar aspects to show how these colour specific days. I am here to
discuss any of these things with those of you who are curious about
them.

The peak of this autumns planetary transits clusters around the end of
October and beginning of November and involves Saturn and Chiron.

Wishing you a magical time,

Everloving,
Dave

Report Period: 23 Sep 2003 to 22 Dec 2003

Positions of the outer planets, Vernal Equinox &#x2013; Winter Solstice 2003

Jupiter: 5-18 degrees Virgo
Saturn: 12-13-10 Cancer (stations on 26th Oct at 13 degrees, then turns
retrograde)
Uranus: 29-28-29 degrees of Aquarius (station direct on Nov 9th)
Neptune: 10-11 degrees of Aquarius (station direct Oct 22nd)
Pluto: 17-20 degrees of Sagittarius
Chiron: 12-17 degrees of Capricorn
Head of Draco: 21-19 Taurus (direct Sept 30th &#x2013; Oct 3rd, then Oct
14th &#x2013;19th, 27th &#x2013; Nov 2nd, November 10th &#x2013; 13th, 18th &#x2013; 24th, and
December 1st &#x2013; 7th, 17th &#x2013; 21st.

Lets look at these positions first.

Jupiter is moving through Virgo with purpose, bringing many great
matters to fruition. This is also characteristic of great cleansings,
purges and the tidying of a big mess. Much of our belief is in simple
and pure things, but we may tend to be blind to a greater picture or
inclined to constipated over analysis. We may need to clear out old
stuff, put things in a new and improved arrangement or order, or tackle
an ever increasing number of seemingly very important things to do in
the day. Yes I know, what the jiminy is new there? ;-) But I think
during this period, we will all be called much more into physical acts
of daily service. Thus, we may need to concentrate on our physical
health, now being an excellent time to start a more nutritious form of
diet. Jupiter is fast approaching a very sharp aspect with Pluto at the
end of the period, which is the crunch of the purification initiated by
Jupiter this season; there will likely be a global increase of tension
(and scandal) at the end of the year, and religion is almost certain to
be at the heart of it. Be aware, however, that this may not necessarily
have direct consequences until the beginning of August 2004, when the
aspect is complete. This aspect also causes conflict in foreign
relations to show itself. In essence, what is happening on both a
collective and individual level is that as we grow more and more
analytical and critical during the purification symbolised by Jupiter,
and then we hit a snare represented by Pluto, which causes us to either
release an ideal or belief, or to revise our plans, and reorganise our
methods and forecasts.

Saturn is hovering over the first three degrees of the second decanate
of Cancer, with an intensive concentration of its energy occurring at
the end of October, around Samhain (Oct 31st). He turns retrograde just
before then; in the sign of Cancer, that of ancestry and memory, family
and heritage, therefore, we can expect the spirits of our ancestors to
draw very close, particularly our elders, grandparents and great
grandparents. Ancient understanding is our teacher now, but we must not
linger in the past, weighed down in memories and nostalgia; instead, we
must restructure what we think of as the notion of family itself, and
Uranus shows us where that boundary must be moved to.

Uranus has as I mentioned last season re-entered Aquarius therefore you
should refer yourselves back to the article I wrote for this summer.
This sign is that of the fellowship of humanity. It is revisiting
Aquarius for the last time now, giving us a last collective opportunity
to envision together and individually our most free future as part of
humanity. Note however that this season its emphasis is on 28 degrees of
Aquarius, (Bardons 29th, the Earth Zone Intelligence named as &#x2018;Nelion&#x2019;
in PME). The end of October is a time of potential realisation which
leads to awakening. This nascent human awareness of humanity itself
coalesces as a vision through Neptune in Aquarius. As Neptune continues
to sift through the shards of the broken collective human psyche &#x2013; and
make no doubt, it IS shattered &#x2013; it will dissolve fragmented ideals back
into themselves and one another, causing a bleed from one ideology and
ideal into the next, rather like a kaleidoscope does with coloured
beads. Consequently, a vision of our future is emerging in our minds eye
&#x2013; do we like it? Before we can say, it changes! Do we still like it? And
so on. The pattern here only really becomes clear when you take a much
broader and higher perspective &#x2013; we are being asked to trust and
unconditionally love the rapid and unexpected unpredictable cycling of
things. Most importantly we must rid ourselves of our delusions and
fantasies about the future, for if we do not, they may entrance us while
the opportunity to act at a crucial time slips by.

Pluto continues its crusade through Sagittarius. We have seen more than
the usual level of disturbance related to religious fanaticism, dogma
and cultural ideology bordering on (and sometimes firmly entrenched in)
xenophobia since it inhabited this region. Expect this to be a theme for
some years. Be aware of its more extreme and irrational manifestations
wherever and whenever you encounter them. We counteract the mass
destructive power of Pluto by dedicating ourselves individually to a
transformative process, in this case, one which transmutes our negative
beliefs and the destructive power of extreme faith. Each of us has a
kind of death wish. There is a sense that, these days, there are even
many people who wish we would all just obliterate ourselves, so they can
watch it on TV. We must face this head on. It is born out of a sense of
hopelessness, of a journey too far over the horizon to ever be
completed.

If you have been following politics recently you cant have failed to
notice the influence of teeny tiny Chiron, in Capricorn. Splits,
divisions, crutches, splints and catastrophic weaknesses in government
structure are all under the spotlight. The situation we have as
individuals towards our ambitions reflects this process too. We are
experiencing our own career woundedness, lack of direction, planning, or
foresight in many cases. Some are building bridges between one career
and another. Others are healing through the highest levels of authority
and control. Qualities we may lack that cause pain for us now are self
discipline, scepticism and realism, conservatism, authority and
ambition. If we possess these qualities in excess, they will start to
show cracks, like the very institutions symbolised by Capricorn. This
passage of Chiron is a hand stretched out in help, offering to heal
before Pluto arrives in Capricorn, where it will inevitably deal with
any corruption in its own fashion.

The Head of the Dragon begins the season retrograde but makes no less
than 6 direct turns and 6 retrograde ones before the Winter Solstice,
yet only traversing 3 degrees of Taurus. It is therefore slowed in
comparison to the summer, during which it took 6 direct turns and 6
retrograde and moved 8 degrees. Therefore things will narrow down, less
will happen in terms of society and the interaction of individuals in
groups, so the changes will be more focused. The occult pattern of this
process is hinted at by the three sabian symbols involved. I have given
these in the text below.

Now on with the more specific explanations:

TRANSITING SUN (Virgo) QUINCUNX TRANSITING URANUS (Aquarius)
Entering 22 Sep 2003, Exact 23 Sep 2003, Leaving 24 Sep 2003
This is the last aspect the Sun makes in Virgo before the equinox resets
the clock, so to speak, by initiating a new phase of the total cycle.
The awkward quincunx relationship between Virgo and Aquarius is easy
enough to perceive, but nowhere near as easy to counteract. Its easier
to give you a metaphor drawn from the sabian symbols. Imagine for a
moment you are taking your usual evening stroll somewhere in a place you
have been hundreds of times, but suddenly you stumble on the ruins of
Babylon, and fall into white moonlit fields.

This quincunx grinds together the bizarre and the unexpected with the
logical and day to day practical realities of life, producing an oops.
If this is not experienced externally it often manifests as frustration,
since the 2 forces create friction within us, but only for a day or two.
We keep changing direction because we encounter unforeseen events.
What is required here is a careful recombining of our most rational and
irrational (or eccentric) aspects, so that one does not trip up the
other. Furthermore, we must not let the dizzy trends in society disrupt
our methods or plans, and vice versa! Confusion, accidental occurrence,
irritable and irrational behaviour may surface if we cannot.

TRANSITING SUN ENTERING LIBRA
23 Sep 2003
This is the equinox. It is the point of solar balance and equilibrium, a
magical moment of pause while the momentum shifts from one side of the
cosmic scales to the other. Day and night is balanced. Here the cycle
shifts its focus from development of the personal self, to the dynamics
of interaction with other selves. Thus, in nature, where it signifies a
shift from light to dark, and in human experience, where it signifies a
gradual withdrawal of life energy from the years personal activities,
this point is a place of power, which is always a place where energy
shifts, and the shift in this case is towards our urge to link up with
partners. This is a good time to look for someone if you are lonely, and
to spend time with your loved ones. We must never forget in the course
of initiation that from time to time we have to look up from our
introspection to smell the roses, that is, no human is an island, we all
need each other, and part of learning to be a complete human being is in
relating to everything human equally. Now is the time to focus on doing
that.

TRANSITING SATURN (Cancer) OPPOSITION TRANSITING CHIRON (Capricorn)
In Orb 22 Sep 2003, Exact 25 Sep 2003, Exact 24 Oct 2003, Leaving 3 Dec
2003
This aspect was discussed in the summer report, so again I ask you to
refer yourself back there.

Those of us with yearnings for the past, family, or a home may be
feeling especially vulnerable in these periods. The issue of
homelessness and societies attitude to it is also of significance to
this transit.

Essentially, this aspect gives us an opportunity to recognise our fear
projections and how they are at cross purposes with our memories and
ambitions, distorting past reflections and future objectives. The
Cancer/Capricorn axis is esoterically rooted in the archetypes of the
Mother and the Father, the Nurturer and Provider, and with the
Saturn-Chiron line up in this area, we can expect flare ups against
authority figures in families with teenagers, cracks in the wall of
governing authority, and an extraordinary level of anxiety and
projection in politics.

On an individual level we may feel that our limitations are actually
crippling, that the weight of responsibility is too great, and that our
fear is just too overwhelming, but if we can see through the illusory
nature of material reality we will perceive that there is always pain in
birth. If the umbilicus connecting us to a past environment is holding
us back, these are the times it may be severed.

Whatever blocks or obstacles appear in our path at these times, the
direct motion of Mars as it slides through Pisces towards Aries should
help us face them. Mars turns direct on Sept 27th, which means that from
that day, we steadily become more active and assertive, our expressions
of Mars grow more external, and he grows in power until he enters Aries
in December, whereupon his most forceful face shows itself. As he
journeys through Pisces, a series of encounters with the other planets
describe his moods. In the beginning they are constructive (trine Saturn
in Cancer, 14th Nov) and healing (sextile Chiron in Capricorn 18th Nov),
but later they become too fussy, dogmatic and idealistic (opposition to
Jupiter in Virgo, Nov 20th) and later still explosive and potentially
self destructive (square Pluto in Sagittarius, Nov 26th), Mars finally
adopting his most warlike and confrontational aspect in Aries (as of Dec
16th). This period, then, of Mars in Pisces, is the calm before the
storm, my friends. The beginning of next year, Mars opens January 1st
with a square to Saturn in Cancer. I will have more to say of this in
the winter solstice report. For now, bear in kind that this is a time to
muster your energy and gather the power of emotional sensitivity to the
suffering of others.

TRANSITING NORTH NODE STATIONARY
The stations of the Node were mentioned above; here I give the degree
the Dragons Head inhabits at each station:

2 Oct 2003 - 22nd degree of Taurus:
Sabian Symbol: White dove over troubled waters.
Earth Zone Intelligence : 'Hyla'. This Intelligence brings a clear mind,
good judgment, and the mental faculties necessary for a crystalline
perception of ideas during studies, such as inspiration and cleverness.

19 Oct 2003, 28 Oct 2003, 2 Nov 2003, 14 Nov 2003, 22 Nov 2003, 1 Dec
2003, 6 Dec 2003, 16 Dec 2003: 21st degree of Taurus:
Sabian Symbol: Moving finger points to significant passages in a book.
Earth Zone Intelligence: 'Hagos'. A master of the magic of the
polarisation of the electric fluid (creating spontaneous growth and
expansion). This magic has many applications! The magician can, for
example, cause a seed to grow within an hour into a tree with fruits
using Hagos' instruction. 'Hagos' is therefore one of the intelligences
who control the growth of all nature on the Earth through the earth
zone.

19 Dec 2003: 20th degree of Taurus:
Sabian Symbol: Wisps of clouds, like wings, are streaming across the
sky.
Earth Zone Intelligence: 'Charagi', inventive intelligence of technical
devices related to agriculture and forestry.

TRANSITING JUPITER (Virgo) TRINE TRANSITING CHIRON (Capricorn)
Entering 7 Oct 2003, Exact 6 Nov 2003, Exact 5 Jan 2004
Now is the time to make the most of any opportunities to lay to rest
painful memories, which have haunted us in times gone by, and move into
areas that are linked straight to our heart. Opportunities for learning
about our flaws and fault lines present themselves and we may discover
talents that we never knew existed beneath them. We have the chance to
express our own teaching and healing talents, finding an appropriate
avenue of expression for faith harvested from the pain of past
experiences. Jupiter-Chiron are sending expansive hyper practical Earth
element energies which can be used for all healing and teaching
purposes. For a business this is an excellent time to train staff and
encourage the growth of reliable connections. For individuals with faith
it is a time of serving to heal society.

TRANSITING JUPITER (Virgo) SEXTILE TRANSITING SATURN (Cancer)
Entering 9 Oct 2003, Exact 1 Nov 2003, Leaving 24 Nov 2003
With this sextile we have more ability to create a fortunate balance
between fun and work, or responsibility and indulgence. We tend to feel
confident in many areas of our life, as we use our good judgement to
make decisions that have definite potential for long-term success. It is
a time when we can tap into our own instinctive ancestral understanding
of life and expand it through rational expressions of faith and belief.
Business dealings may prosper. The only drawback could be that we tend
to take this time for granted and let opportunities slip through our
fingers. In other words &quot;wise and considered action&quot; is what is needed.
Here we also have the potential to put things in a proper perspective,
taking into account a distinction between emotional needs and anxieties,
including logical and pragmatic clarity.

TRANSITING JUPITER (Virgo) QUINCUNX TRANSITING NEPTUNE (Aquarius)
Entering 11 Oct 2003, Exact 16 Oct 2003, Leaving 22 Oct 2003
Our religious views and personal ideals are challenged during this time.
Any delusions of a grandiose nature we have or of being right due to
irrefutable evidence may be tripped up. We may become disillusioned
either with our own personal goals or with the world in general. As a
result we tend to let go of ideals of the past, and adopt a new belief
system or at least a new vision of an old one under his vibration. This
is therefore a period of testing of our convictions and ideals.

TRANSITING NEPTUNE STATIONARY in Aquarius, turns direct.
22 Oct 2003
The movements of Neptune coincide with fashions and trends in society,
especially those which involve moving images and the imagination, and
its current position in Aquarius is a very awakening and enlightening
one for these faculties. Its direct motion now will tend to externalise
and project the most incredible fantasy images into the world, both
through cinema and the dreaming we inhabit with our minds eye.
This station takes place at 10 degrees Aquarius, the 11th degree of that
sign (since a sign begins at 0- 1 degrees). The Sabian symbol for this
transition of the imagination and psychic senses is

&#x201C;Artist, away from the world, receives a new inspiration&#x201D;

Therefore, for any seeking psychic and spiritual inspiration through
meditation, Oct 22nd is a good day to do it. Especially as the next day&#x2026;

TRANSITING SUN ENTERING SCORPIO
23 Oct 2003
&#x2026;sees the solar energy begin to magnify the power of psychic energy and
initiate a transformation of natures pattern through autumns fires.
These psychic fires literally burn the Libran beauty from the trees, and
leave them crispified beneath our feet; nature decomposes, but it feeds
the next cycle with fertile nutrients. Scorpio is thus the period in
which we should do the same; our wise progenitors knew the magic of
honouring their ancestry, and appeasing the ghosts of the shadow worlds
at this time of year. We often become more passionate and intense
towards life when we are surrounded by signs of death, and so at this
time we often feel our passions rise in response to natures fall, simply
because we cannot accept death as individuals. It is a good time for us
to investigate those matters we would normally be too afraid to, a time
to summon or root out our penetrating insight and examine our own hidden
motives and secret desires. Qualities we should adopt more of to
synchronise with life are magnetism, fearlessness, psychic radiation,
sexual passion and deep conviction. It is the best time of year to dive
into whatever dimension of existence is &#x201C;unknown&#x201D; to you, not to learn
or acquire knowledge, but to feel it happening in your gut.

TRANSITING SATURN STATIONARY in Cancer, turns retrograde
25 Oct 2003
The stations of Saturn are often times of enormous pressure, where
maximum stress occurs. The retrograde station in Cancer most often drags
up things we thought were history, so we tend to be in the grip of old
fears and memories. Suddenly we realise how responsible we are for our
own failings, rather than the outer world. It becomes easier to perceive
the nature of our own fears and how they actually place those obstacles
in our own path. I get the strong feeling that this station summons
truly ancient history from the depths, and thus it gives us a golden
opportunity to literally change the past. Lets look at the sabian symbol
together:

&#x201C;An old man, alone, faces the darkness in the northeast.&#x201D;

The earth zone head of this degree is a master of invisibility. The old
man in this case is clearly Saturn, or those aspects of us which are
embodied and expressed by Saturn in Cancer at this time. The darkness in
the northeast is many things, perhaps a literal warning as well as a
metaphorical one referring to troubles in Mother Russia and her
surroundings, but more certainty and with more practical benefit, it
relates to those old and forgotten fears which nevertheless still
influence us across the gulf of time and must be addressed during the
introspective period of the retrograde movement. This period continues
until March of 2004, but the effects of the pressure of the station are
limited to the end of Oct. It is advisable that if you must have
important dealings with authorities of any kind, you try and do so
before this period begins, and the sooner the better!

TRANSITING SUN (Scorpio) SQUARE TRANSITING NEPTUNE (Aquarius)
Entering 30 Oct 2003, Exact 3 Nov 2003, Leaving 7 Nov 2003
Some keywords of the days solar energy:
Confusions and chronic lack of clarity. Unknown and hidden factors which
challenge. The practical use of art and music fuelled by
impressionability. Escapist urges. Misunderstandings and broken dreams.
Visions which deceive. Mistakes and errors in judgment. Foggy or scatty
situations. The potential for sudden psychic flashes from out of the
blue.

TRANSITING SUN (Scorpio) TRINE TRANSITING SATURN (Cancer)
Entering 2 Nov 2003, Exact 6 Nov 2003, Leaving 9 Nov 2003
Some keywords of the days solar energy:
Control over one's emotional life. A deep and passionate but steady
sense of rationality. Intensive but steady and regular accomplishment.
Supreme success in overcoming astral obstacles. Building on the past.
Good relations with authorities. Endurance. Patience. Utter persistence.
Concentration and mental focus. Success in dealing with limitations.
Sound instinctive judgments.

TRANSITING SUN (Scorpio) SEXTILE TRANSITING JUPITER (Virgo)
Entering 2 Nov 2003, Exact 6 Nov 2003, Leaving 11 Nov 2003
Some keywords of the days solar energy:
The urge to grow in a methodical and rational manner. Consciousness of
moral or religious issues. The desire to uncover the facts or to reach
out to new ideas through penetrating insight into the minutae. Optimism
and confidence, especially concerning the willingness to speculate or to
take a risk.

TRANSITING SUN (Scorpio) SEXTILE TRANSITING CHIRON (Capricorn)
Entering 2 Nov 2003, Exact 6 Nov 2003, Leaving 11 Nov 2003
Some keywords of the days solar energy:
Healing and a creative approach to wholeness. Power meetings with
authorities who open the way up. Healing deep astral wounds through
appealing to a higher authority. Seeing the way through. Knowing the
problem and its solution.

TRANSITING URANUS STATIONARY in Aquarius, turns direct
8 Nov 2003
Rather like the fashions and trends described by the journey of Neptune,
the passage of Uranus is connected to the flow of energy through
societies, only in this case it is the flow of ideas, opinions and the
current inspiring genius. Thus, the stations of Uranus point to periods
during which the flow of ideas moving society into the future is
reversed, not in the sense that they hearken to the past again, but in
the sense of where we seek for them. When direct, Uranus is
revolutionary; yet when retrograde, Uranus is counter-revolutionary.
What is the difference? The difference is that one is, of course,
reactive, which means that it is not so much inspired to move into the
future towards something, but rather to kick against something. This
stationary position is one of the former.
Its degree is given the following symbol:

&#x201C;Metamorphosis completed, a butterfly spreads its wings.&#x201D;

Again, this hearkens back and reminds us of the last years Uranus has
been in Aquarius, opening our minds enormously in a very short space of
time. This period is the full stop to that process, a recollection and
revision of mental awakening before the initiation of human
consciousness and awareness becomes overwhelmingly emotional (Uranus in
Pisces).

TRANSITING SUN (Scorpio) OPPOSITION TRANSITING NORTH NODE (Taurus)
Entering 9 Nov 2003, Exact 13 Nov 2003, Leaving 17 Nov 2003
This aspect causes an eclipse of the Moon from our perspective.
Essentially, it denotes the necessity to cooperate with others,
obligatory teamwork, forced adjustments (especially to financial
situations), schedule pressure, dealings with families or groups which
are closely bonded, questions of leadership and authority and strangely
uncomfortable feelings. Meetings may be cancelled or postponed.

TRANSITING JUPITER (Virgo) SQUARE TRANSITING PLUTO (Sagittarius)
Entering 10 Nov 2003
This aspect will not be exact at any time this season but will grow
until reaching maximum closeness at the end of December, then Jupiter
retrogrades out of Pluto&#x2019;s reach until swinging back for an exact square
in the first week of August 2004. Therefore, watch the global scene at
the end of the year, for you will see those trends returning and
intensifying 8 months later.

Jupiter is the planetary force of growth and expansion; as it travels
through the zodiac it shows us what is currently expanding its
importance in the world, and what will be expanding in the future. At
this time it is challenging us all to make a great transformation in our
life by uprooting and discarding deeply buried parts of it, a process
which may be reflected in a time of enormous upheaval and change around
us. Tensions may arise as we struggle to achieve our goals. It seems as
though other people and external events are deliberately plotting to
thwart our every move, but really we are all just responding together to
the vibrations of this aspect. However, it may be that we are inclined
to going overboard in our attempts to get our own way. The trouble is
that we want to make great changes in our life, but lack the necessary
tolerance and patience to get the timing right. While taking action can
certainly have positive effects in the long run, we would also be wise
to find the right balance of confidence and patience.

Jupiter is also linked with faith and belief and at this time our faith
may be severely tested. If it is like an old rope, frayed and weak, our
faith may break, and we will then fall; but if our faith is strong and
does not falter, we will overcome many great obstacles. This is a time
in which we can express great spiritual zeal. Spiritual zeal is a great
virtue, for it ensures that we will continue to walk in harmony with
Gods Will. However, when spiritual zeal is not tempered with
unconditional love and forgiveness, it is a fire which rages out of
control, as graphically demonstrated by the Inquisition. Therefore, if
we act with unconditional love and forgiveness at this time, we can
perform miracles once thought impossible, instead of burning alive
whatever does not agree with us.

Another possibility with this transit is that we attempt to rejuvenate
something, either an aspect of our life or something in it like a home.
There is a desire in us to restore and rebuild things now, on all
levels. But we must be aware that our energy and zeal may attract the
attention of others who oppose our beliefs. There is also a potential
within this transit that we will become obsessed with something. We
should stand up for what we believe is right but need to be certain that
we are speaking and acting from our deepest inner self, in other words,
we have to make sure that we truly believe what we say we believe, and
be ready to walk the talk, or problems will result.

TRANSITING SUN (Scorpio) SQUARE TRANSITING URANUS (Aquarius)
(Entering 17 Nov 2003, Exact 21 Nov 2003, Leaving 25 Nov 2003
Some keywords of the days solar energy:
Exposure to, or confrontation with, new ideas and information which
challenge the status quo. Surprises and reversals that change
everything. Misapplication of technical data. Technology breakdowns. A
nervous restlessness. Efforts to understand change and unconventional
behavior.

TRANSITING SUN ENTERING SAGITTARIUS
22 Nov 2003
Today the emphasis shifts dramatically from dark and mysterious to a
more sunny and adventurous vibration. We tend to become more naturally
optimistic and philosophical, and may tend to bluntness in this period.

Sagittarius is a good time to focus on religion and the basic
fundamental beliefs we hold about life, philosophy for example, as well
as a restless need for outdoor activity which is partly motivated by the
sense of fading light and life in the world, so that a kind of last
burst of activity takes place (just check any high street). Qualities we
should work more closely with are honesty, optimism, personal truth, the
willingness to take a chance, trust and broad mindedness. It is an
excellent time for fixing ones sights on something over a horizon.

TRANSITING JUPITER (Virgo) TRINE TRANSITING NORTH NODE (Taurus)
Entering 24 Nov 2003, Exact 6 Jan 2004
During this time we have the chance to improve our relations with other
people, and to make new connections. We may meet a particular person, or
take up with a new group of people. Either way this connection could
help us expand our horizons in life.

This trine can have a positive effect on our life as long as we
recognise the opportunities, and do not pass them up. Jupiter &#x2013; the guru
of the zodiac &#x2013; is opening up the past and the future simultaneously,
giving us the tools and methods we need to build true spiritual
security.

TRANSITING SUN (Sagittarius) SEXTILE TRANSITING NEPTUNE (Aquarius)
Entering 29 Nov 2003, Exact 3 Dec 2003, Leaving 7 Dec 2003
Some keywords of the days solar energy:
Physical sensitivity to thoughts of others. Receptivity to mental
impressions. Prophetic dreams. Focusing the intangible. Intuition. The
finished masterpiece. Art appreciation.. Wide expanses. A lucky vision.
Unusually restless creative impulses.

TRANSITING PLUTO (Sagittarius) QUINCUNX TRANSITING NORTH NODE(Taurus)
Entering 3 Dec 2003, Exact 17 Dec 2003, Leaving 30 Dec 2003
We are likely to reassess our goals during this period. It's time to
review our achievements in life and ensure that we are still on the
right track. As a result many may be changing their life ambitions,
experiencing a spiritual reorientation and regeneration that is
confusing or frustrating, or feeling that for some reason we cant quite
explain we feel locked out. We will need to be patient. It is most
likely, however, that this aspect will simply be absorbed in the
Christmas rush for most people. Yet nevertheless, an underlying tension
in society will no doubt be present, a feeling that something is not
right, or that dark powerful forces are at work behind the scenes. This
strange feeling passes by the end of the year.

TRANSITING SATURN (Cancer) QUINCUNX TRANSITING NEPTUNE (Aquarius)
Entering 4 Dec 2003, Exact 14 Dec 2003, Leaving 23 Dec 2003
I have mentioned this aspect in the summer guide, so once again, I ask
you to refer yourself back there to read what I wrote about it. It is
quite an awkward aspect that tends to create mixed signals. Its
astrological meaning is essentially unaltered, although the symbols have
changed:

&#x201C;A Chinese woman nursing a bay haloed by divine light.&#x201D; (Saturn)

&#x201C;Lifes broad stairway: each landing, a new grade of life&#x201D;. (Neptune)

Each of you should reflect upon this, in the light of your current
experiences.

TRANSITING SUN (Sagittarius) SQUARE TRANSITING JUPITER (Virgo)
Entering 6 Dec 2003, Exact 10 Dec 2003, Leaving 14 Dec 2003
Some keywords of the days solar energy:
The urge to grow in ways or areas that may present problems or expose
flaws and inadequacies. Efforts to do too much or be too perfect. The
urge to travel. Growth-stress. Overconfidence. Bombastic rationality.
Over-optimism. Overload. Awareness of moral or legal issues. Awareness
of differences in opinion. Confrontations with bigotry.

TRANSITING CHIRON (Capricorn) TRINE TRANSITING NORTH NODE (Taurus)
Entering 8 Dec 2003, (Exact 5 Jan 2004)
In short, this aspect is connected with healing energies being exchanged
between different egregores or groups of like minded individuals. Now is
the time for us to be more open to opportunities to discover and express
our special gifts. If we believe that everyone has a purpose in this
world then now is our chance to discover ours and make the most of the
doors that open. It is also possible that we are given the chance to
mend broken bridges during this time, which will in turn pave the way
for a brighter future.

TRANSITING SUN (Sagittarius) CONJUNCTION TRANSITING PLUTO (Sagittarius)
Entering 9 Dec 2003, Exact 12 Dec 2003, Leaving 15 Dec 2003

magnetism. Determination to proceed beyond the barriers. Decision time.

acceptance. Sharing and trust. Financial power used philanthropically or
without resistance.

others for a specific cause or purpose. Going on a crusade.

TRANSITING SUN ENTERING CAPRICORN
22 Dec 2003
This marks the winter solstice and the next phase of the calendar year,
and thus, the end of this guide.

I hope it is of some service to each of you,

everloving,
Dave
