&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I tried the merkabah for several months, and I don't
&gt; think the two systems can be compared. Drun just
&gt; gives a tool to increase your energy, whereas Bardon
&gt; lays out the structure to integrate ascension into
&gt; every part of your life. Energetically, the merkabah
&gt; feels mostly electrical, but that may just be my
&gt; predilection. I guess both systems deal with raising
&gt; your vibration, but isn't that the basic premis of
&gt; every form of initiaion? I could never seem to go
&gt; forward with the Merkabah when I got to a certain
&gt; point when things got a bit &quot;charged up.&quot; Merkabah
&gt; definitely brings up soul mirror issues, as your
&gt; energy is amplified. The kundalini itself is supposed
&gt; to burn through those issues so that you can become
&gt; aware of the lightbody, and increase your
&gt; consciousness. That's all great, my only problem is
&gt; what to do with my spare time when I am done
&gt; meditating. There's no integration; I still have my
&gt; dreams but the increase in energy doesn't really help
&gt; me to work more intelligently or creatively. It helps
&gt; to stimulate the mental faculty, but in my case I was
&gt; already too mental, so it exacerbated the air element.
&gt; It could have been brought back into balance if I
&gt; continued with the correct meditative attitude. The
&gt; soul mirror will help with any other system. I spent
&gt; a lot of time trying to figure out how the two systems
&gt; were compatible, but now that is just another item on
&gt; my soul mirror. I will always be intrigued about the
&gt; fantastic technique, but the only way I can concieve
&gt; of proving its reality is to master IIH.

&gt; &gt; Hi everybody!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I d'ont know if you have heard of Drunvalo
&gt; &gt; Melchisedeck who talks
&gt; &gt; about the sacred gemoetry, flower of life and the
&gt; &gt; merkabah (the
&gt; &gt; lightbody). In the merkabah m&#xE9;ditation he says you
&gt; &gt; activate the
&gt; &gt; lightbody structure by breathing and accumulating
&gt; &gt; the prana 18th time
&gt; &gt; along a tube in your back similar to the sushumna
&gt; &gt; with the chakras system.
&gt; &gt; He explains that the mental body is electric in
&gt; &gt; nature and the astral
&gt; &gt; body is magnetic. By breathing and condensing prana
&gt; &gt; in the geometry
&gt; &gt; structure of these bodys which are a pairs of
&gt; &gt; tetrahedrons (like the
&gt; &gt; 6point star but in 3D), and once you've condensed
&gt; &gt; enough energy in
&gt; &gt; you, you blow it outside and then make the structure
&gt; &gt; rotate, the
&gt; &gt; mental sould turn tetrahedron counter-clockwise and
&gt; &gt; the astral
&gt; &gt; tetrahedrons clockwise, you can activate the
&gt; &gt; lightbody (which looks
&gt; &gt; like an UFO once activated) and travel in every
&gt; &gt; dimensions and planes
&gt; &gt; in the universe. He says a lot of extra-terrestrials
&gt; &gt; do the same with
&gt; &gt; their ships that are often lightbodies. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When i discovered Bardon i was so surprised i found
&gt; &gt; there are some
&gt; &gt; similarity in the two technics like accumulating and
&gt; &gt; condensing the
&gt; &gt; vital energy in the body or traveling trough the
&gt; &gt; other realms. And
&gt; &gt; making theses geometric structure (electric vs
&gt; &gt; magnetic) spining
&gt; &gt; together in the merkabah meditation looks like when
&gt; &gt; Bardon talks about
&gt; &gt; making a big electro-magnetic Volt.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sometimes when i'm doing the TMO it makes me think
&gt; &gt; of this merkabah
&gt; &gt; technique by the fact that in the two we accumulate
&gt; &gt; energy in the
&gt; &gt; bodies and then we send the energy out of the body
&gt; &gt; in a explosive way.
&gt; &gt; And in the triple shield when Rawn Clark talks about
&gt; &gt; spinning the
&gt; &gt; energy around the bodies it also remind me of the
&gt; &gt; merkabah meditation
&gt; &gt; in which we move the accumulated energy around the
&gt; &gt; body. the
&gt; &gt; difference is that in the triple shield the three
&gt; &gt; rotate in clockwise,
&gt; &gt; howether in the merkabah meditation the energie hold
&gt; &gt; in the mental
&gt; &gt; body counter-rotate the astral.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But i'm wondering if these technics are totally
&gt; &gt; different because the
&gt; &gt; TMO refer to the tree of life and in the merkabah
&gt; &gt; meditation no. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'd like to have your opinion on all this. I've read
&gt; &gt; here that
&gt; &gt; sometimes it would be better not to work two
&gt; &gt; different systems at the
&gt; &gt; same time. But may these two techniques be
&gt; &gt; complementary, i think of
&gt; &gt; visiting other world and realms? 
&gt; &gt;
