<pre>Dear Alan et al.,

Personally, I'll have to agree and disagree with Rawn at the same 
time. The issue of whether or not you have done the work of Hermetics 
before is irrelevant due to the fact that you have, and you will. 
However, having an understanding that you have, and are, and will, be 
performing the work of Hermetics can have an effect upon what you do 
within the here and now, and potentially help you progress upon the 
path. The reasoning behind this all is, like most things in regards 
to Hermetics and Kabbalah, quite complex, so bear with me while I try 
to explain the method of my madness.

To me, this revelation came to me shortly after seeing a post upon 
another board using the tree of life diagram to explain reincarnation 
and the various levels of the self. The main problem that I saw with 
this was that he was using a two dimensional diagram, the tree of 
life, to try to explain a multidimensional construct. You see, when 
you start talking about reincarnation, or more properly, incarnation, 
one has to start dealing with an infinite number of incarnations of 
the divine unity along an infinite continum of time and space. The 
tree of life diagram only shows the various levels of self for one 
incarnation and only hints at the fact that there are an infinite 
number of other tree's of life surrounding and interconnected with 
your current incarnation. After all, if, as the pattern of the 
trestleboard suggests, &quot;I am center of expression of the primal will 
to good.&quot; Then everyone else, everything else, and everytime else, in 
fact, has to be an expression of that primal will to good as well.

To conceptualize this one should look at the four major levels of 
self as presented upon the tree of life; Kether, Binah, Tiphareth and 
Mulkuth respectfully. Kether is the unity, where all is one, and one 
is all. Kether subsequently manifests itself in an infinite number of 
Binah selves, or greater selves, otherwise known as greater guardian 
genius' or holy guardian angels. Each one of these Binah selves 
manifests itself down into an infinite number of Tiphareth, or 
indivindual selves. Each Tiphareth self manifesting itself down into 
an infinite number of physical incarnations within Mulkuth.

As such, we have infinities within infinities. A conundrum similar to 
that of the fact that both an infinite number of days, and an 
infinite number of centuries are both the same amount of time: 
infinite.

Because all of these various levels of self have to operate 
throughout the whole period of temporal existence, then from the 
perspective of the unity of Kether, they are all happening at the 
same time due to the fact that this Kethric self has to operate in a 
sense of timelessness and spacelessness. For, if this Kethric self 
was bound by time and space, it could not encompass all of creation.

Now how does this knowledge potentially effect one's practice of 
Hermetics. If one acknowledges this fact, then one also acknowledges 
the fact that you are, in some way, shape or form, just another 
incarnation of the divine unity that manifested itself within the 
form of Franz Bardon. Moreover, this divine unity is manifesting 
itself in a form of yourself, somewhere in the temporal future, that 
has completed and mastered whatever exercise that you are currently 
working on within IIH. Knowing that you will, and have, and are, (all 
at the same time no less) a master of these exercises has a habit of 
making these exercises just a little bit easier at times.

Of course, for most people reading this, you will probably be able to 
grasp what I am saying upon an intellectual level. But to be able to 
put this into practice is another matter alltogether. For me, the 
practical application of this knowledge took shape within the work of 
TMO step 7 and 8. I wished to come in contact with my incarnations 
that had mastered, or at least progressed well along the path of 
Kabbalah and attempt to draw back some of that mastery and experience 
with Kabbalah to the present moment. Hopefully being able to use some 
of that understanding to set the tone of the present moment in such a 
manner that it will help my progression along the path to Kabbalah. 
In doing so, I sent the wave of adonai light out throughout time and 
space and, quite to my surprise, that I came in contact with quite a 
number of different incarnations that had progressed well upon the 
path to Kabbalah: a half dozen or so within the temporal past, and 
several dozen more in the temporal present and future. All of which 
are performing the tasks that divine providence sets out for them in 
their own unique way. While I feel a kinship with them, I also know 
that I am seperate from them. Though I know that I can merge with 
their consciousness and experience their life through their eyes. 
Henceforth expanding my sense of self as well as garnering another 
perspective upon the divine. Even though that perspective is my own 
as well.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
