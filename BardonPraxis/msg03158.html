Hello All, I'm Sarah--currently reading through IIH, but have not actually
started the process . I've been lurking here for about the last 2 months,
and have liked what I've seen. At this point, events are conspiring that
have made it evident that i need to reach a slightly more settled and stable
point in my life before i start doing much more involved work than my daily
meditation and T'ai Chi practice, but I hope to learn a lot from this group
so that I can get off to a good start when I am ready, for I feel that this
is the next major phase in my spiritual/magical life. Luckily, I have some
good friends who independently discovered bardon about the same time as I
did, and once all our lives calm down we may be able to formsome sort of
informal working group.

Anyway, I had to respond to something Chuck said:


&lt;&lt; I have been learning solid basics in my inner workshop by leaps and
bounds, in peace, in the past week whereas before it was all a struggle in
unanswered blind faith. 'In peace,' is a key phrase. When you really eat a
morsel of nourishment it settles 'in peace' while being digested and after
digestion you have the wisdom/experience that begins adding things up,
matching this to that, to make pieces attach to other logically. This is
what is needed to solidify our walk, to make it real and growing.

This is the work, I know, and we are all to find our own ways, so trial
and error is the only way. This is my point. Because I had stretched myself
so thin in so many varying directions at the same time I couldn't really
feed the hunger for a &quot;solid&quot; foundational bit of nourishment. I was eating
only junk food that was not even being digested by my system, just
expectorated right out of me. I had done it, but gotten little to nothing
out of it.&gt;&gt;

This is what I've been feeling the last few weeks as I've been settling into
Bardon's theories, but I hadn't been able to put it into words. Thank you,
chuck, for being so eloquent! the last 8 years (give-or take) have been a
blur of spiritual treasure hunting, from zen to paganism to catholicism back
to paganism to Ceremonial Magick to Taoism and on and on. It was a
neccessary part of my spiritual maturation, and I learned things in the
theological and magical schools of hard knocks that no book can impart. But
I'm getting older. 30 is looming ahead in a few years (you may all laugh
sarcastically now at a 20-something fretting about aging), and I just feel
like the &quot;seeking&quot; phase of my life is drawing to a close, and the
&quot;building&quot; phase has begun. I've found a lifemate, a wonderful city in which
to live, a fulfilling career, and generally am starting to settle down in
all the senses of the word. I've been seeking after Wisdom all my life in
one form or another, and am starting to learn that Her deepest mysteries
can't be found merely by running around sucking up knowledge, it has to be
gained from a firm foundation of peace. That's what the next few years are
shaping up to be for me, a process of building that solid foundation of
peace in all the areas of my life, so that Wisdom may truly speak to me and
enter all aspects of my life.

My Solstice/new year's resolution will likely be to start the actual work of
IIH, and I am sure I will have many questions then. But for now I'll just
work on quieting my mind and perfecting my Snake Creeps Downward. Thanks for
reading my ramblings.

Sarah
