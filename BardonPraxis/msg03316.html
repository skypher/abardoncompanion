No, no, not rambling on at all. I thank you for your elaboration. It 
is helpful to me and believe me there are others who are getting 
something from it.

But in 'particular' I wondered if you could elaborate on this 
specific section for me to explain what you meant please;

meditate on the tetragrammaton itself and its
significance

I think this is where you are using a sentence where it means all 
the world to you 'but' each of us may be seeing the relavance of the 
word 'tetragrammaton' from our own experiential level with our own 
description attached to it, but what exactly do 'you' mean when you 
use the tetragrammaton in the meditation please? 

Thanks

I wish you well
Chuck

&gt; Hello Chuck, when I said
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;My only other comment on the whole process so far is that the 
&gt; mental helps with the astral. As in, once you get good at Thought 
&gt; Discipline you can meditate on the tetragrammaton itself and its 
&gt; significance, and then be constantly aware, ...&quot;&lt;&lt;
&gt; all I meant was, and unlike what a cursory read of IIH seemed to 
say to me 
&gt; at 1st anyhow, Thought Discipline (step 1 mental ex 2) is really 
about being 
&gt; able to think very clearly and deeply without deviating - but it 
still is 
&gt; thinking, a *chain* of thoughts, not stopping them. If you ever 
write well and 
&gt; really concentrate on what you actually mean it's just the same - 
but the paper 
&gt; is your mind, and instead of grabbing thoughts from a stream you 
watch the 
&gt; whole stream carefully, or that's how it's starting to seem to 
me, but I'm not 
&gt; expert yet I wouldn't say. So I use that to dig into the 4 
elements and kind 
&gt; of watch them working in a general way. Why would someone say 
something so 
&gt; bizarre as that the universe comes down to them? This took me a 
while and I 
&gt; still haven't got it, but it's like there's a logic to them. They 
fit together 
&gt; and complement each other.
&gt; 
&gt; So once you see that in principle you start to notice it in 
practice on alot 
&gt; of levels, or that's what I found. You can almost watch that 
overbalancing 
&gt; on a positive element going to the negative in terms of mood - in 
a 
&gt; conversation for example, too much enthusiasm giving way to 
irritation, too much 
&gt; sympathy and compassion turning into depression, too much 
lighthearted banter 
&gt; turning into mischief, too much weight and gravitas becoming 
locked into dogma, etc 
&gt; etc for example. So you feel a way you can walk forward without 
toppling and 
&gt; in doing so you are using the other side of that same exercise, 
the one 
&gt; where you stay aware all day. I mean, I give social examples but 
they don't have 
&gt; to be of course. You stay focussed on whatever it is and notice 
what your 
&gt; natural reaction is.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to run on. Never ask *me* to 'elaborate', unless you really, 
like, 
&gt; *mean* it!
&gt; 
&gt; You said: 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;Think of it, nobody has 
&gt; any of the same situation in their early growing years. We may 
all 
&gt; have one parent, two parents, but we have a different family 
friend 
&gt; who always has an impact on us for instance.&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; ... and I think you're spot on there. I think family is something 
magic 
&gt; doesn't usually touch on but it's really interesting and I do 
think about it 
&gt; alot. Not only all the usual stuff about early experiences (I do 
think some 
&gt; Freudian ideas have something to them now, which I never did 
before - who would 
&gt; have thought *magic* would do that??) but also, as bardon himself 
said, the 
&gt; Akasha in its 'coarsest form' lies in the blood and semen (or 
egg). There is a 
&gt; strong tie to me of fate in family, in everything to do with sex. 
It makes 
&gt; sense to me as a male, looking at how one behaves at puberty when 
all the stuff 
&gt; comes flooding in. One could say that's when certain karmic 
burdens start 
&gt; functioning, I'm just speculating here I don't know for sure.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway the thing is the Hermetic approach allows you to see it. I 
don't 
&gt; really think you need spend alot of time reliving the past 
deliberately, but you 
&gt; do kind of need to know if you're doing it subconsciously! Who was 
it who said 
&gt; that the things we fear most have already happened to us? Anyhow, 
praise to 
&gt; Bardon because his course is a thing of beauty. Sometimes when I 
first read 
&gt; it it seemed almost thrown together, but as it turns out it's 
really 
&gt; incredibly precisely engineered and that's why it delivers, so 
I'd say.
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes, Jason
