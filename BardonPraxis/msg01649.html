<pre>Dear Rawn,

as usual your explanations are fertilizing the own thoughts and experiences.
But there still is left one point worth discussing:

You wrote: &gt;Power is a product of the clarity with which a *form* (be it
physical, astral or mental form) expresses its (Akashic) essential meaning.
The metals express their essential meaning with great clarity at each
level -- 24k Gold being an example of perfect clarity in which even the
physical form is a perfectly clear expression of the essential meaning.&lt;

Would this mean that the purer a metal the stronger its power?

In alchemical writings you often can find declarations the raw material i.e.
the ore of a metal be more located to the root of the metal or in your terms
to its expression of its essential (akashic) meaning (of all three levels
mental, astral and physical) than the perfectly purified metal. They say,
that an ore after heating and reducing it to the pure metal looses its
ability to become living in an alchemical sense. They say, the metal be dead
instead of still alive. How can you explain the difference between your
statement of a pure metall having &quot;more power&quot; to these traditional
statements of being dead i.e. without still containing the living metallic
energy of life?

According to my experience there is an explanation which can bring together
both seemingly contradictory &quot;theories&quot;. A pure metal is very closed in an
alchemical sense, i.e. to release its great power is the more difficult the
purer the metal is. And because WITHOUT THE AID OF A MEDDLE MATTER - the
universal solvent - you never can get the energies you are searching for: a
pure especially a precious metal is &quot;dead&quot;. But &quot;dead&quot; means in no way
&quot;without power&quot;, it only means useless for alchemy because of the lack of
its own medium for releasing power. Or: A metal is too much closed in our
physical world so that we could use its hidden fire or inner energy
directly.

But the ore of a specific metal is still in its natural matrix i.e. bound to
a kind of womb of its being so that using the ore together with its matrix
it is much easier to release the energies of the hidden metal though the ore
itself really is impure and cannot express the essential meaning with such a
great clarity than the pure metal is able to. In an ore the essential
meaning is strongly darkened, but nevertheless an ore is more alive than the
pure metal enclosed in it.

The important conclusion: The essential meaning is much clearer and more
perfectly expressed in a pure metal. But to really release it practically
it's easier to use an ore. Or - as an alternative of great practical
importance - if you know the mentioned &quot;meddle matter&quot;, you can directly
extract the essence out of a pure metal easier than using the ore (another
seeming contradiction). In the alternative case you only have to learn how
you can get your &quot;meddle matter&quot; outside of the ore or metal you are working
with.

So the contradiction is only a seeming one. Regarding the clarity a pure
metal has reached a much higher level than an ore. But regarding the
easiness to extract the pure energies hidden in the metal the usage of an
ore is the more appropriate method.

Could you agree with this my explanation from a magical point of view i.e.
&quot;reading in and out of the things&quot;? Have you some more thoughts about this
matter very basic to alchemy?


Kind regards and all the best for you as always

Beat Krummenacher
