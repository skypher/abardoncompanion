<pre> Figured i'd post some ideas that were bouncing around my head, 
be good to get it all writen down ( and make sure im not way off 
base ) 

I was reading some translations of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, and 
thought that it might help me understand the theory section of IIH 
better ( ok...Bardon starting out the theory section with a quote 
from it was a little hint..) Basicaly what i got was this:

Everything came from the one, which im taking to mean the Akasa, 
since Bardon says that all the elements came from it. Next the 
tablet says that the Sun was the father of the one, and its mother 
was the moon, which seemed odd at first since you cant give birth to 
your parents, but I think the Sun represents fire and the Moon 
represents water. The male force is active, female receptive, and 
also in my version bardon says &quot; ... must have been fire and light, 
and in the Bible we read: &quot;Fiat Lux&quot; ? There shall be
light. The origin of the light, of course, is to be sought in the 
fire. &quot; about the element of fire, so that reminded me of the sun.  

next the tablet says that wind only carried the one, and it was 
never suggested that it played a more active role, so through a 
briliant leap of deductive reasoning i asociated the element of wind 
with the 'wind' refered to in the tablet. In some versions of the 
tablet it also says that earth caried the one, but when it does it 
syas that it carried it within its breast, and the other 
translations say that the earth nourished the one. So i think that 
the carried here means two different things for each, the carried 
for the wind meaning more like it carrying the one along between the 
elements, and for earth meaning carried and nutured inside of it, 
like the spirit inside of gross matter, the subtle in the gross or 
the 3 elements interacting to create the 4th one and the tetrepolar 
magnet.   

after that it talks about seperating the fire from the earth/subtle 
from the gross, and many other metaphors for the alchemical process. 
so what i took that to mean in relation to IIH was the process of 
working on refining the elements. From there the tablet talks about 
a ascending to the uper and coming back down to the lower, and the 
subtle and gross joined together to become one. I have next to none 
experience with the later steps in IIH, so ill leave that as is.

Now that its all writen out it dosent seem that much of a leap of 
logic...just hope i took the right leaps. Eh, looking at the tablet 
and comparing it to the tetrepolar magnet helped me get a little 
insight into how the elements work together anyway..you know, 
actualy, i think Bardon's theory section helped me make sense of the 
tablet and not the other way around. Some translations made less 
sense than my posts ( at least to me anyway ). Well, feel free to 
tear apart my logic, shouldnt be too hard.
