<pre>Many thanks, mj.

To close this subject, the fact that I asked this
question concerning the theory (as did others for
other subjects) does not mean that I *limit* myself to
theory, at the expenses of my practice :-)

However, the experiences related by the other students
showed me that I can limit my efforts on this side for
a little while.

With my best messages

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;It might help if rather than thinking of these

&gt; &gt; tie them to, to make them real for yourself. &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can you elaborate, please ? I'm interested in all
&gt; &gt; possible ways to improve my meditations on the
&gt; &gt; Elements - and the questions they raise. Thanks in
&gt; &gt; advance.
&gt; 
&gt; I can elaborate only a very little. I'm not so
&gt; far on this path 
&gt; myself. 
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that the first rule of esoteric
&gt; study is to accept 
&gt; nothing, verify everything. We could talk all day
&gt; about cats, their 
&gt; shape, color, disposition and habits, but nothing
&gt; will teach you as 
&gt; much about cats as actually seeing one, hearing one,
&gt; interacting with 
&gt; one. When you speak of the Element Fire, what do you
&gt; mean? Have you 
&gt; seen it, interacted with it, felt it, known it? What
&gt; experiences have 
&gt; you had, physically, emotionally, and mentally could
&gt; you connect with 
&gt; the vague concept of Fire? For me, Fire is hot and
&gt; expanding, 
&gt; energetic. You can light a candle and watch it, feel
&gt; it, think about 
&gt; it, observe yourself and see what feelings and
&gt; thoughts it inspires. 
&gt; You can sit in the sun on a summer day, feel it, the
&gt; heat on the 
&gt; skin, the jumpiness in the mind, the muscular
&gt; tension and discomfort 
&gt; that comes. Watch yourself when you grow angry, you
&gt; can actually feel 
&gt; the heat flash through your body and cloud your
&gt; mind. All of these 
&gt; things will give you actual first hand experiences
&gt; that you can draw 
&gt; on and tie to the abstract symbol of &quot;Fire.&quot; For me,
&gt; this is all a 
&gt; corollary from the exercises of the first step,
&gt; namely thought 
&gt; observation. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt; Dear forestofsymbols,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Many thanks for your message.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;it sounds like you might be confusing the
&gt; elements
&gt; &gt; (fire, water, earth, air, and ether) and the
&gt; levels
&gt; &gt; (physical, astral, mental). &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I re-read my message, and I understand your
&gt; feeling
&gt; &gt; :-). English is not my mother tongue (as you may
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; guessed :-) and the following sentence,
&gt; particularly,
&gt; &gt; could have been written more carefully :
&gt; &gt; -----
&gt; &gt; does the &quot;shaping&quot; of the raw energy issued by
&gt; Fire
&gt; &gt; take place at the Water level ?
&gt; &gt; -----
&gt; &gt; What I meant was simply &quot;is the raw energy issued
&gt; by
&gt; &gt; Fire shaped by Water&quot;.
&gt; &gt; In spite of my clumsly wording, I don't have the
&gt; &gt; feeling I made a confusion between Elements and
&gt; Planes
&gt; &gt; (...although physical corresponds to the Earth
&gt; &gt; Element, astral to the Water Element, Mental to
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; Fire Element etc., ... and knowing that Astral is
&gt; an
&gt; &gt; intermediary between Mental and Physical. Aarghh.
&gt; &gt; Just wanted to ensure I confused everybody :-) :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Given the correspondance just mentionned above, I
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; tempted to answer myself &quot;yes&quot; to my own question
&gt; &gt; (does water give form to Fire). But I'm still not
&gt; &gt; sure.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The question I asked is valid for all planes, not
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; the physical one.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;It might help if rather than thinking of these
&gt; &gt; things in the abstract, you find some experiences
&gt; to

&gt; &gt; &gt; you are also

&gt; &gt; &gt; This was my own mistake as I've recently
&gt; discovered.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oops. Here are a few sentences I forgot to
&gt; &gt; &gt; include. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know that the actual *solidification* (&quot;let
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done&quot;) takes place at the Earth Element -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electromagnetic level.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question is not about this level:
&gt; &gt; &gt; solidification is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distinct from shaping IMHO. My question is
&gt; really
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the original &quot;Intention/Design&quot; : does
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shaping&quot; of the raw energy issued by Fire
&gt; take
&gt; &gt; &gt; place
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the Water level ?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; May sound confusing (and confused) to the
&gt; other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; students. I apologize ...but I still need to
&gt; know,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because till now I believed that Water was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shrinking&quot;, so to speak, something already
&gt; formed
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solidified at another level, but I did not
&gt; imagine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it was taking a role in the shaping
&gt; process.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok. I'll stop worsening my case :-)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many thanks
