<pre>Olivier,

&gt;From my limited understand, both a right in one fashion or another.

The Fire, Air, Water, Earth attribution order refers to how the 
structure of the elements exists within the human body. That is: fire 
in the head, air in the chest above the diaphram, water in the guts 
bellow the diaphram and earth in the legs. When the actual Hebrew 
letters of Yod Heh Vav Heh are written top to bottom, as are found 
within the photos section of the Bardon Praxis yahoo group, they show 
the figure of a human being which is sometimes called Adam Kadmon, 
the primordial man. This is a more Hermetic viewpoint than a 
Kabbalahistic viewpoint, in my opinion.

The Fire, Water, Air, Earth attribution order refers more to the 
sequence which the elements came into existence. First comes Fire, or 
more appropriately, the electric fluid, then the Water, the magnetic 
fluid. At which point Fire and Water, the electric and magnetic 
fluids, combine in a state of equilibrium to form Air. The simplest 
way of understanding this is that when fire and water are combined, 
steam, Air, is produced. Interestingly enough, Bardon's conception of 
vital energy, sometimes known as Qi or Prana in other traditions 
typically translates out into meaning something akin to &quot;breath&quot;. 
Vital energy, as Bardon presents it, contains roughly equivelent 
amounts of the electric and magnetic fluids. Finially, the element 
Earth, which really isn't a true element within the Kabbalahistic 
sense of the term, is the direct consequence of the union of Fire, 
Water and Air. The Heh final is the result of the combining and 
permuting of all of the Hebrew letters, as shown within the Sepher 
Yetzirah with only the first three letters of IHV. This is a more 
Kabbalahistic viewpoint as opposed to a Hermetic viewpoint.

Also, if you look at the picture of the Third Tarot Key, in the 
inside square that results from the golden burst of akasha, you'll 
note that the colour symbolism, starting from the top right and going 
counter clockwise is: red, green, blue, brown. Or rather; Fire, 
Water, Air, Earth. Thus indicating that Bardon knew both the Hermetic 
associations, as well as the more traditional Kabbalahistic one.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist

&gt; I'm by no means an expert Kabbalist, but I find the progression of 
Fire, 
&gt; Water, Air to be the more logical choice for two reasons. First,  
Moryason 
&gt; says &quot;Air 'surges' from the Akasha after the Fire (Akashic) and 
before the 
&gt; Water&quot;, when this does not follow from the analogy of air in the 
natural 
&gt; world. In order for air to flow, it must go from an area of high 
pressure 
&gt; to an area of low pressure. To say that the Air &quot;surges&quot; assumes 
that 
&gt; there was some contractive, accepting thing for the air to flow 
into. This 
&gt; is the very definition of what water is meant to represent. The 
second 
&gt; reason is that Fire calls for Water to exist as soon as the first 
is 
&gt; created, but Air is only needed when it is necessary to communicate 
or flow 
&gt; between the first two. Fire and Water are polar opposites, and one 
can not 
&gt; exist with out assuming the existence of the other. The concept of 
Air 
&gt; expresses a flow of something, and as mentioned before, there must 
be an 
&gt; expansive and a contractive force for this flow to occur.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps,

&gt; &gt;Subject: [BardonPraxis] YHVH-Tetragrammaton
&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 16 Mar 2004 14:46:29 +0900
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Dear All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have a problem with the individual letter-to-element 
associations of the 
&gt; &gt;tetragrammaton in KTQ.
&gt; &gt;Alexandre Moryason, publisher of Bardon's work in France, in 
its &quot;Lumiere 
&gt; &gt;sur le Royaume&quot; p. 119, adopts the same associations as Franz 
Bardon in its 
&gt; &gt;KTQ i.e: Y=Fire, H=Air, Vav=Water, and the final H=Earth. Rawn 
Clark, in 
&gt; &gt;its commentary upon the theory of KTQ explains that the 
association should 
&gt; &gt;instead read: Y=Fire, H=Water, V=Air, and the final H=Earth.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;How can these seemingly different correspondances be reconciled??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;While I am nowhere near practicing KTQ, it is important for me to 
have at 
&gt; &gt;least a basic understanding of what the associations are. I have 
read 
&gt; &gt;Rawn's commentary upon KTQ's theory, as well as his marvellous 
commentary 
&gt; &gt;upon the Table of Hermes and understood his explanations as to why 
the 
&gt; &gt;sequence of formation should read: Fire-Water-Air-Earth instead of 
&gt; &gt;Fire-Air-Water-Earth.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have also read Moryason's comments, which I very loosely 
translated as 
&gt; &gt;follows:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&quot;3-The Air
&gt; &gt;Only the Divine Breath, the balancing influence between the two 
opposite 
&gt; &gt;elements, Fire and Water, allows for their interaction. 
Air &quot;surges&quot; from 
&gt; &gt;the Akasha after the Fire (Akashic) and before the Water (if a 
sequence of 
&gt; &gt;events could even be conceived...). Consequently, the Air 
corresponds to 
&gt; &gt;the Second Letter of the Divine Name, He (and not Water) and Water 
&gt; &gt;corresponds to the Third Letter (Vaw).
&gt; &gt;Air represents thus the Divine Breath and if it is inexistant, the 
union 
&gt; &gt;between Fire and Water becomes impossible: death occurs; and it is 
truly 
&gt; &gt;what can be observed with physical breathing when it ceases.
&gt; &gt;Air constitues also the vehicle of freedom, agility, the generator 
of the 
&gt; &gt;&quot;Movement&quot;, of Life...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;4 - Water
&gt; &gt;(...)
&gt; &gt;The link between Fire and Water seems so self-evident that along 
centuries, 
&gt; &gt;certain Kabbalists have attributed to Water the position 
immediately 
&gt; &gt;following that of Fire, and to which corresponds the Second 
Hebraic Letter 
&gt; &gt;of the name of God, &quot;He&quot;. This is inaccurate.
&gt; &gt;Although it is actually true that Fire calls for Water and that 
Water calls 
&gt; &gt;for Fire, these two elements cannot communicate to each other. 
Their 
&gt; &gt;discrepancy is such that a Mediator is necessary so that their 
interaction 
&gt; &gt;can work and produce everything that exists in the Universe, in 
any 
&gt; &gt;existing Plane. This Mediator is Air, the manifestation of the 
Divine 
&gt; &gt;Breath, existing within every thing.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The above passage I obtained from someone who has Moryason's book. 
I do not 
&gt; &gt;have the book myself.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any insight welcome!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Fraternally,
&gt; &gt;Olivier
