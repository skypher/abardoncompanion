<pre>By the way, Yod-He-Vav-He (IHVH) is believed by many to be the 
causative form of a lost verb in Hebrew for &quot;To be&quot;. If it is so, 
then it meant &quot;He causes to be&quot; or &quot;He brings into existence&quot;.

In response to John's post:

Phoenician was spoken in Lebanon and along the coast (to some 
extent) of North Africa where it was called Punic. It is not related 
to Berber (other than being in the Afro-Asiatic family) and the 
Berber people are not descended from Phoenicians. They have been in 
North Africa for a very long time.

Hamitic is an old word that linguists (though I am not one) have 
pretty much dropped. Phoenician was Semitic as were the Canaanite 
language(s) and Hebrew. I believe the 'Hamitic' you are talking 
about used to be used to group languages like Somali (now called 
Cushitic).

Aramaic was a sister language to Hebrew that grew to encompass most 
of the Middle East in Ancient times...Jesus and the people of his 
time spoke it. They were similar, but not the same. 

Aramaic later came up with another alphabet in three versions. They 
sort of look like Arabic but blockier.

You are right about the living Semitic languages. The three major 
Ethiopic languages are the ones most people don't know about: 
Amharic, Tigre and Tigrinya. They are descended from the language of 
ancient South Arabian (present day Yemen) invaders called Ge'ez (in 
Axum). 

The famous (sort of famous) Keber Nagast was written in Ge'ez if I 
am not mistaken. I think a part of the Book of Enoch is recorded in 
it, but I am no expert in Biblical apocrypha or anything.
