<pre>Dear Joa,

&gt;&gt; As I said I am very sad about your retirement, and I would like to
make you some questions before I never can communicate with you again.
:( &lt;&lt;

As I pointed out to Go, folks will still be able to contact me by
visiting <a  href="../Contact.html">http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/Contact.html</a>

&gt;&gt; 1) Lying on a bed with the hands on the abdomen, can be a good form
of working all the exercises of IIH or not? Is it better, from the very
beginning, adopt a sitting position of the yoga? I have great doubts
about this. &lt;&lt;

Ultimately, you want to be able to accomplish the exercises no matter
what position your body is in so that means it is wise to work with
different positions, some comfortable and some not, so that you will
learn to control your mind and its reactions to your bodily position,
under any circumstance. On the other hand, it is also good to find a
position that you are comfortable in and let that be your *usual*
working position.

&gt;&gt; 2) Why is it necessary awaiting to the step 2 for changing a negative
trait character? I think that if I am conscious of a negative trait
character I have the moral obligation of changing it from THAT moment,
because, what if I never reach the step 2? &lt;&lt;

The reasoning behind it is that you don't have an accurate and holistic
map of your character traits until you have completed your Soul Mirror
lists. Until the Mirror is finished you don't have a comprehensive
understanding of the overall context within which that individual
character trait exists. Furthermore, the other exercises in Step One
teach you the rudiments of the Step Two techniques that are applied to
the character transformation work.

Ultimately though, the decision is yours to make.

&gt;&gt; 3) I practice the &quot;thought control&quot; exercise twice a day. I have
attained a better control of my mind, and it is relatively easy for me
to get my thoughts as if they were coming from a remote distance. This
is so the greater part of the days, but NOT all the days. Can I consider
that the exercise is dominated? (By the way, the second time of the day
is more difficult to me to reach that state) &lt;&lt;

I suggest that you move on to the second mental exercise and in that way
test whether or not you have mastered the first exercise sufficiently.

&gt;&gt; 4) How much time can be extended the exercises of step 1? One hour,
for example? &lt;&lt;

I recommend that you follow the guidelines Bardon offered in that
regard.

&gt;&gt; 5) Suppose that in my work with the soul mirrors I have found that I
have vertigo or fear of the heights. Can be a good idea to expose myself
to extreme experiences (for example, climbing mountains) to overcoming
that negative trait? (of course, mixing the action with the
autosuggestion) &lt;&lt;

It couldn't hurt. :)

&gt;&gt; a) Can they be an adecuate tool to discover the True Will or that is
another subject that has nothing to do with the soul mirrors working? &lt;&lt;

The Soul Mirror work, or rather the *character transformation* work is
the first step in uncovering what you have labeled your &quot;true will&quot;.

&gt;&gt; b) I am very surprised with your commentary (and with the Bardon&#xB4;s
one)when you say, in your commentary upon IIH, that the initial process
of self-analysis must be done in a time limit of one to two weeks. &lt;&lt;

Neither of us stated that it *must* be done in that time frame but it is
an ideal amount of time for the reasons I stated in my commentary. Your
Soul Mirror is not a one-shot deal where you do it once and that one
time has to be perfect. Quite the contrary -- it is a lifelong process
and your Soul Mirror is always evolving. It is more important that you
move forward in the process than that you get it absolutely perfect the
first time around. :)

&gt;&gt; c) I have seen very clearly that the traits tend to go full circle
and end where they started. And there are six or seven traits that
influence or are the root of many of the others. But when I finish my
work, what can be the more adecuate strategy to attack the &quot;spider&#xB4;s
web&quot;, all this enormous puzzle? &lt;&lt;

As Bardon suggested, begin work with one of those six or seven major
negative traits. By pulling that one thread, many others will unravel
simultaneously.

&gt;&gt; Well, Rawn, thank you VERY much for your patience and support. And
good luck!!! :) &lt;&lt;

Thanks. :)

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
