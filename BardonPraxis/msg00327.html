<pre>TO ALL:
With the group's permission, I would like to recommend these
&quot;self-editing&quot; steps:
1.) Please, cut out nonspecific quotations from letters to which
you may be responding; this will reduce clumsy redundancies and transfer
time/storage of ALL mail. Even the casual participant doesn't need to
read a complete &quot;chain&quot; of letters and responses.
2.) Please, include specific page/text references, where
possible, such that we can &quot;learn with you&quot; or respond appropriately.

Many thanx to all the openness and helpful references/clarifications re.
the above topics (AIR and SUBCONSCIOUS).
I have deep interest in &quot;management&quot; of the unseen realms of my thought
process and how to bring them under control and into view.

I was particularly interested in Bardon's writings, early on in IIH,
relating to subconscious, autosuggestion and how we are to view our
relationship with it as &quot;it's&quot; caretakers (pp. 82-86; should be re-read).
I found this section of the text of pivotal importance in that it made a
marked change in my mental clarity, spiritual sight and use of our innate
power.
Upon meditation and repeated affirmations (IN and OUT of meditative
states; eg. during the shower, drive to work, etc.) several appropriate
affirmations came to mind. The most important one was the 1st one which
I would like to share in this venue. (Please, take time to reread and
remember Bardon's finer points of the teachings/keys for the full
effect.)
By way of review and as a statement on how these are used, remember to
repeat this AT LEAST 40 times. Beaded or knotted prayer ropes are
helpful, here. (I will offer a &quot;ropeless&quot;, hands-free musical/mental way
to keep track of your affirmations at a later date....it's kinda fun. ;-)

As a 1st move into this regaining of control and changing of your point
of view, my actual affirmational statement was: &quot;I reclaim my
subconscious.&quot; (you can visualize yourself as a triumphant soldier,
plunging your banner-flagstaff into the ground of your mind, here -just
for fun.)
The underlined word can be changed to &quot;retake&quot;, &quot;claim&quot;, etc. as you feel
comfortable. Remember, YOU are in command and this must be stated in the
present.
After this (next day?) changed the words to &quot;I'm in control of my
subconscious.&quot;, or &quot;claim&quot;. 
This affirmation/exercise is NOT meant to replace any other exercise(s)
you may be doing but ONLY to enhance related work or to aid in the
clarification/mastery of the unruly mind; take it or leave it. 
In helping my music students to control their stage fright, I tell them:
&quot;Remember, YOU are in the driver's seat.&quot;

Finally, thank you for this lengthy indulgence of your time.
