<pre>Hi,

For illness' where a patient is not a hermetic student, does not have 
the necessary foundation or is not at the right stage in life to be 
confronting their own serious issues to the point of being cured of 
their illness(s); it would seem logical to me that the &quot;cure&quot; would 
have to come by external means.

Today we have a wide variety of alternative medicines, many of which 
are useful for curing a wide variety of ailments to certain degrees. 

One that I have started exploring recently is called &quot;Pranic 
Healing&quot;. Pranic comes from the word &quot;Prana&quot; or &quot;Chi&quot;, referring to 
life energy/force. Pranic Healing thus pertains to the ability to 
(positively) manipulate the energy body of another human being such 
that a degree of energetic equilibrium is achieved. The basis of why 
this works to cure an ailment is that a disease is always reflected 
on the energy body, or more correctly stated, it manifests first on 
the energy body before it becomes a physical disease. This explains 
why certain clairvoyants can look at a person and know they are going 
to be sick and of what sickness before they even become sick. 
By 'fixing' the energy body by means of removing energetic 
congestions or feeding the right type of energy to the right points 
where the energy body is depleted and to the appropriate chakras, a 
temporary energetic balance is achieved and shortly there after, the 
physical body is affected and eventually cured.

Some advanced diseases like Multiple Sclerosis and Cancers may 
require months of treatment sessions before the disease is completely 
gone. However; this of course all depends on the power and ability of 
the healer. A parallel is drawn here with magic ritual, in that an 
advanced magician may acquire result after only performing a short 
ritual once and a novice may have to repeat a very complex ritual 
dozens or more times before the same desired result is acquired. The 
more advanced the healer, the faster the patient will get cured. But 
there are also limits like, even some advanced healers, despite all 
their power can not simply blast the patient with energy because the 
patient's ability to absorb that much energy is limited and too much 
too soon could simply cause more damage.

Pranic Healing books by Choa Kok Sui are now available in over 20 
languages and suggest that pretty much all diseases (karma allowing) 
can be cured. Pranic Healing centres exist in over 50+ countries now 
and so visiting one of these healing centres and getting treatments 
by a sufficiently advanced practitioner may very well help those that 
need immediate externally bestowed cures.

I also wish to point out that in the bibliography of the first book, 
titled &quot;Miracles Through Pranic Healing&quot;, IIH, PME &amp; KTQ are 
recommended reading material by the author, and as a whole, I would 
have to say that the teachings of Mr. Choa Kok Sui are well in 
alignment with hermetic principles even though no direct parallels or 
mentions are given.

Lastly, I think we shouldn't forget one of Rawn's conclusions in that 
you can cure diseases all you like by taking the latest miracle drug 
or treatment, but if the root cause isn't addressed, the disease can 
simply return. The root cause of diseases does not lay within the 
energy body, so even if you get Pranic healing, eventually and 
perhaps in parallel you should also try to identify and address the 
root causes.
