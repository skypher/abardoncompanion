<pre>Greetings, everyone;

Yesterday my wife and I had a heart to heart discussion on three
topics of deep personal matters. Relationship, time-energy, lifestyle
details. This was a time when my wife came to me and needed to know
where we stood on certain matters and I was in the middle of something
else (study) and I put it down and focused on her and I. 

What was interesting was that I immediately came into the space of
realizing the Archaeous work on levels 1-4, I kept moving my
consciousness around to the four elements in each of my three
bodies, physical, astral and mental, trying to locate where the
feeling or center was for the &quot;feeling,&quot; the occurance of &quot;thought&quot;
and for the &quot;response&quot; to certain things she was saying or I was
thinking, feeling, saying. A lot of the discussion was entirely
emotional. 

This was entirely exciting and enjoyable to me. As the active work
within the workshop (myself) was actually being identified and sought
out as practical application. And it wasn't contrived at all. This is
a very important part even as I realized it as it was all occurring.
Because of intense, honest, applied study this response presented
itself as natural. Very, very exciting to me to realize this and be
within it while it was happening &quot;consciously.&quot; 

I only identified one element, mental thoughts, of all that was
happening, of all of the pointed and wide searchings within myself
while the discussion was happening within the hour and 1/2 of my wife
and I relating openly. But just one identification was wonderful, as
the process of what was occuring was more exciting than anything else
immaginable. 

And all of the time there was no break in the natural communication
with my wife as we were interacting. :) I LOVE the real work! :)

Anyone who is farther along the path knows these joys of realizing one
is on the &quot;right&quot; path. 

Anyone who has not gone there yet, please don't be envious. Realize
this: that I studied self actualization intensely 20 years ago for a
mere three years, a slow beginner, using the eastern system of the
Chackras identification of our internal systems. And for twenty years
I have simply been a good friend, a damned good masseur and went about
my every day life. Every other year I would pick up the Sephir
Yetzirah and view pictures of the Caballa and &quot;know&quot; that there was
something there for me, read the S.Y. over and over for a couple of
months and put it all down each year. Then just this year after 20
years of gestation I am finally beginning the inner work seriously in
the the &quot;workshop&quot; of my internal self. We all have our own pace on
our life path.

I think we all should celebrate together our personal joys!

I Wish You Well,
Chuck
