<pre>Hi,

I tried the merkabah for several months, and I don't
think the two systems can be compared. Drun just
gives a tool to increase your energy, whereas Bardon
lays out the structure to integrate ascension into
every part of your life. Energetically, the merkabah
feels mostly electrical, but that may just be my
predilection. I guess both systems deal with raising
your vibration, but isn't that the basic premis of
every form of initiaion? I could never seem to go
forward with the Merkabah when I got to a certain
point when things got a bit &quot;charged up.&quot; Merkabah
definitely brings up soul mirror issues, as your
energy is amplified. The kundalini itself is supposed
to burn through those issues so that you can become
aware of the lightbody, and increase your
consciousness. That's all great, my only problem is
what to do with my spare time when I am done
meditating. There's no integration; I still have my
dreams but the increase in energy doesn't really help
me to work more intelligently or creatively. It helps
to stimulate the mental faculty, but in my case I was
already too mental, so it exacerbated the air element.
It could have been brought back into balance if I
continued with the correct meditative attitude. The
soul mirror will help with any other system. I spent
a lot of time trying to figure out how the two systems
were compatible, but now that is just another item on
my soul mirror. I will always be intrigued about the
fantastic technique, but the only way I can concieve
of proving its reality is to master IIH.

&gt; Hi everybody!
&gt; 
&gt; I d'ont know if you have heard of Drunvalo
&gt; Melchisedeck who talks
&gt; about the sacred gemoetry, flower of life and the
&gt; merkabah (the
&gt; lightbody). In the merkabah m&#xE9;ditation he says you
&gt; activate the
&gt; lightbody structure by breathing and accumulating
&gt; the prana 18th time
&gt; along a tube in your back similar to the sushumna
&gt; with the chakras system.
&gt; He explains that the mental body is electric in
&gt; nature and the astral
&gt; body is magnetic. By breathing and condensing prana
&gt; in the geometry
&gt; structure of these bodys which are a pairs of
&gt; tetrahedrons (like the
&gt; 6point star but in 3D), and once you've condensed
&gt; enough energy in
&gt; you, you blow it outside and then make the structure
&gt; rotate, the
&gt; mental sould turn tetrahedron counter-clockwise and
&gt; the astral
&gt; tetrahedrons clockwise, you can activate the
&gt; lightbody (which looks
&gt; like an UFO once activated) and travel in every
&gt; dimensions and planes
&gt; in the universe. He says a lot of extra-terrestrials
&gt; do the same with
&gt; their ships that are often lightbodies. 
&gt; 
&gt; When i discovered Bardon i was so surprised i found
&gt; there are some
&gt; similarity in the two technics like accumulating and
&gt; condensing the
&gt; vital energy in the body or traveling trough the
&gt; other realms. And
&gt; making theses geometric structure (electric vs
&gt; magnetic) spining
&gt; together in the merkabah meditation looks like when
&gt; Bardon talks about
&gt; making a big electro-magnetic Volt.
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes when i'm doing the TMO it makes me think
&gt; of this merkabah
&gt; technique by the fact that in the two we accumulate
&gt; energy in the
&gt; bodies and then we send the energy out of the body
&gt; in a explosive way.
&gt; And in the triple shield when Rawn Clark talks about
&gt; spinning the
&gt; energy around the bodies it also remind me of the
&gt; merkabah meditation
&gt; in which we move the accumulated energy around the
&gt; body. the
&gt; difference is that in the triple shield the three
&gt; rotate in clockwise,
&gt; howether in the merkabah meditation the energie hold
&gt; in the mental
&gt; body counter-rotate the astral.
&gt; 
&gt; But i'm wondering if these technics are totally
&gt; different because the
&gt; TMO refer to the tree of life and in the merkabah
&gt; meditation no. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to have your opinion on all this. I've read
&gt; here that
&gt; sometimes it would be better not to work two
&gt; different systems at the
&gt; same time. But may these two techniques be
&gt; complementary, i think of
&gt; visiting other world and realms? 
&gt; 
&gt; namaste
&gt;
