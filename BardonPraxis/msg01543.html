<pre>The philosopher, John Baines had something very interesting to say on the 
subject of Hermetics:



=================================== John Baines Forum #32 - Sept 30 The Spirit 
===================================&quot;For the spirit, the physical body is a 
heavy load when it does notrespond to the messages and actions that the spirit 
desires it to undertake; it islike a black veil which limits and clouds the 
vision. Self-mastery means learning toperfectly handle the complex and 
extraordinary machinery which is our physicalbody.&quot; &quot;In general, the condition 
of the human being can be compared to that ofan individual who enters a very 
complicated automobile without knowing howto drive it. The physical body of a 
man who has neither cultivated nordeveloped his consciousness, is like an 
automobile traveling a long distancewithout a driver.&quot;&quot;In order to clearly 
visualize the spiritual problem of mankind, we willoffer the following
simile. The spirit is pure energy of a high vibration whichpenetrates a 
material body of a low vibration. All that the spirit tries toexteriorize is 
lost, like a radio transmitter of a high frequency that has to be retransmitted 
to a lowfrequency receiver (the body). Logically, it is impossible for this 
receiver (the body) to receiveanything at all, until its frequency level is 
increased to that of the transmitter (the spirit).&quot;&quot;The power of the human mind 
has no limits and the day will come whenman will have attained perfect mastery 
of the mind enabling him tomaterialize his thoughts, and giving him the ability 
to achieve the integration of matter.&quot;From Chapter 10: &quot;The Dominion of 
Oneself&quot; of The Secret Science, byJohn Baines

Hello friends,

I am new to this group and I am still practising Bardon's step one. 
But the last week I had some kind of a problem. I had obsessive 
thoughts, I couldn't consestrate, my mind went blank, had absence of 
emotional responsiveness and reduction in awareness. As you can 
understand my first thought was that &quot;ok you are a mad man now, 
don't panic you just have to go to the psyciatry clinic&quot;. I have 
always been really nervous guy. Always something to do, couldn't sit 
down, always in a mood that &quot;I have to leave now&quot; and lots of other 
things that a really nervous guy can do. When this &quot;crisis&quot; slow 
down a bit I searched in the internet about mental problems and I 
found very interesting things. All the symptoms that I have a few 
years now are stress symptoms caused by a trauma. Now, about 
Bardon's work I have done something really foolish. I have done the 
mental exercise WRONG for five months. So, a week ago when I 
understand this got really anxious and stressfull and I think that 
these stressfull feelings might triggered this crisis. What I want 
for you, please, is just an advise. To stop Bardon's course it is 
not a sollution because it is very importand to me, is like a life 
purpose. And except from this in first step we learn to control our 
mind which for me I think that it is the best therapy for my 
problem. I can't afford a therapist and even if I could, I couldn't 
tell him about Bardon and occult because he woudn't understand. So, 
what do you thing, should I stop Bardon's course or should I fight 
it? Do you thing that this course could be a therapy for my 
problem? 

Regards, Kostas
