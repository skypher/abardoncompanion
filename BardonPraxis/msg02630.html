<pre>Dear RM and all,

&gt; Dan, you certainly have a knack for raising
&gt; interesting issues! :) 

Thank you. One of the great joys of this Work is that,
for every issue that is resolved, another takes its
place. It certainly keeps life interesting!

&gt; Method 1 (shamanic): Become aware of where your
&gt; emotion seems to 
&gt; reside in the body. Imagine it is a kind of Astral
&gt; object that can be 
&gt; independently manipulated by your Astral self. Use
&gt; your Astral hands 
&gt; (just imagining yourself doing this is sufficient)
&gt; to reach inside of 
&gt; your body, grasp the emotion and carefully draw it
&gt; out of yourself. 
&gt; Now throw it away. When you first try this technique
&gt; you will feel a 
&gt; kind of tingling sensation in the body where you are
&gt; grappling with 
&gt; your emotion. Once you throw it away it will (at
&gt; first) generally 
&gt; come right back. As you gain experience you will be
&gt; able to throw the 
&gt; emotion away and it stays away. Back here in the
&gt; physical plane - low 
&gt; and behold, the troubling emotion is gone.

I like this method a lot although, as you mention, it
is probably more suited to forceful emotions. One
concern I have is that one may become reliant on the
technique. The constant use of this exercise to
eliminate negative emotions may not help the aspirant
to deal with the underlying issues causing these
emotions to arise. However, I can see a good use being
made from this if one encounters, say, a hostile
situation and uses this technique to &quot;rip&quot; out the
anger from other people. Have you tried this
particular application?

&gt; Method 2 (quasi Hermetic): English is a poor
&gt; language for describing 
&gt; inner states but I'll do my best. In this technique
&gt; you learn to 
&gt; become &quot;transparent&quot; to your emotion. You let if
&gt; flow around and 
&gt; through you while your consciousness remains very
&gt; still and does not 
&gt; interact with the emotion. You still feel the
&gt; emotion but in a more 
&gt; abstract way. I call this &quot;quasi Hermetic&quot; because
&gt; it is very similar 
&gt; to the thought observation technique described in
&gt; IIH. The emotion 
&gt; flows through you, then away and then it is gone.

The similarities between this technique and some of
the exercises in IIH are loud and clear!

After writing my last post, I meditated further on
this issue. The clear message was that we, as
students, must always bear in mind that
self-transformation is an iterative process. It is not
simply a case of creating the Soul Mirror in Step 1
and working through the major and then minor character
flaws. As Rawn notes in his commentary to Step 1 of
IIH, the Soul Mirror work should be periodically
updated. However, what one should find is that, in
creating the second Soul Mirror, the flaws that are
considered the most major (and requiring immediate
attention) are less pervasive than the most major
issues identified in the first Soul Mirror exercise.
Subsequent Soul Mirror exercises should highlight
progressively less fundamental flaws (although the
number of flaws themselves may not change, and may
indeed increase!).

Kindest regards

Dan
