<pre>Dear Mark,

&gt;&gt; I have a query regarding free will. Rawn mentioned a while ago that
by living in the temporal now is the only way you can maintain free will
(after you reach a certain level of integration with the higher self and
the all). I have long been under the impression that there is no free
will at any point as every action undertaken is a perfect representation
of every circumstance that has lead to the present level of
consciousness, thus any action / reaction that occurs in the physical
is, by definition, the only action that could have taken place; any
other response / action / whatever is physically impossible to happen.
So the question is, to what extent is there genuine free will, as I am
under the distinct impression that the illusion of free will in workers
is the main driving force behind life and QED the magics. &lt;&lt;

For the sequentialized mind, the apparent conflict of free will is the
most difficult aspect of the eternal perspective to integrate.

The fact that what *is*, is as it should and must be, applies *only* to
what *is* -- i.e., to what *exists*. From an eternal perspective
*EVERY* thing *exists* and the whole infinite span of time (i.e., the
sequential realm) *exists* as a whole -- within an infinitely
encompassing *Now*. So *in* the eternal realm, it's a fait accompli and
there is no free will (in the mundane sense).

However, in the sequential realm the only thing that *exists* is the
present moment of the sequence. In the sequential realm, the past
doesn't *exist*, nor does the future *exist*. The only thing that
*exists* in the sequential realm is a finite *now*. Since future does
not yet *exist*, it is *created by what transpires within the finite
now*. Free will is our ability to decide *right now* how we will act
and it is these temporal decisions that create the future; or rather,
when we make a choice, we change the *now* and move it forward through
the sequence.

Within the temporal present moment we *do* have free will. In fact,
everywhere within the sequential realm we have free will.

An important aspect of integrating the eternal perspective (or rather,
the eternal *experience*) into the sequential layers of conscious
awareness, is learning how to hold these opposite perspectives
simultaneously. One must be able to function within the temporal realm
and consciously exercise their free will, while simultaneously remaining
aware of the eternal perspective. And vise versa, while in the eternal
perspective, one must also be cognizant of one's temporal existence and
experience. [This deepens the eternal experience since its essence is
that of *participation* (immanence) and not that of separation.]

This means that the enactment of one's temporal free will and the
intentional creation of the future (i.e., continual re-creation of the
*now*) are essential parts of true &quot;ascendance&quot;. This is what brings
the eternal *into* the temporal and &quot;heals the rift&quot;.

My previous comment to you in private regarding the loss of free will
when one relies upon the eternal perspective to view what, from the
temporal present moment, appears to be &quot;future&quot;, will hopefully make
more sense now. :) When you *know* what your next choice will be
*before it has occurred temporally*, you are then bound to following
*that* choice. In other words, there is no longer any *choice*. The
essence of free will is the *power to choose*. This power stems from
Chokmah (Wisdom) and is an *essential* part of the sequential realm. It
is not an &quot;illusion&quot; as many state -- it is a Primordial Law.

&gt;&gt; Also, does the extent of potential free will differ depending on the
level of an initate? &lt;&lt;

No. One's freedom to will is infinite. What *does* differ is one's
ability to *manifest* their will. This has primarily to do with the
fact that the process of initiation brings the individual into ever
greater harmony with the Divine. The petty will is transformed into the
Divine Will. Ultimately, none of one's willings conflict with the
Divine Will and there is then a *direct* and immediate manifestation of
one's free will. But you must understand that the Infinite Divine Will
manifests *through* the finite free will exercised an infinite number of
times throughout an infinite number of temporal present moments.

Many equate this with greater freedom, but this is not so.

&gt;&gt; I am aware that this arguement can be used as the perfect cop-out for
anything, but I think it's also a necessary realisation for ascendence.
&lt;&lt;

To my mind, it's the easy way out. It absolves one from all
responsibility for their actions and for the future. If that were the
Ultimate Goal, then why bother. ;-)

This attitude/assumption is also indicative of a dis-Equilibrium of the
Elements in the temporal mental body, with roots in the astral
personality structure. It reflects a character need to be absolved of,
or to avoid, personal responsibility. Often, this is very subtle -- so
subtle that it doesn't make itself known to the initiate's consciousness
until the work of integrating the eternal experience is begun.

One doesn't just *cross* the Abyss -- one must also *return*. :) There
are two legs to the journey.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
