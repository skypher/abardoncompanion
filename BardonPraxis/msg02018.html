<pre>Dear Stu,

I wasn't trying to make a good schoolmaster out of Rawn with my 
comment. It was my indirect way of saying that I am starting over 
from the beginning. 
I first ran into Bardon when I was 16. I would skip steps 
because I was very arrogant, egotistical and emotionally sensitive at 
the same time. I would still get some of the results I was after, 
but I was in no way balanced to make it worthwhile or qualitatively 
effective. I do, however, want to change that aspect for myself and 
others. I am better than I was with my ego, even in the past year, 
but I still have a great deal more to go.
Thank you for your comments. I do take them seriously.

~Louis de Sully

&gt; Dear Louis
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Hopefully, my future undertakings will leave your eyebrows 
untouched
&gt; &gt;as I take the more traditional path of learning. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I see your smiley, but I think that making a &quot;good 
schoolmaster&quot; out
&gt; of Rawn is not a good idea. To try to please the moderator of this 
group
&gt; will give no merit. I've tried...
&gt; 
&gt; Rawn has assisted us in many ways, but as far as I know Rawn is not 
God,
&gt; and it's an insult to God to treat Rawn as if he was ;-) I don't 
say you
&gt; did that, but I recognise in your comment what I sometimes do 
myself. I am
&gt; sure that experimenting can be important and valueable. Not mainly 
because
&gt; of results but because of the impulse to try things, in order to 
find the
&gt; best solution.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think it can be taken for granted that all 400 of us have 
found our
&gt; &quot;path with a heart&quot; in the Bardon way. I would guess that a number 
of us
&gt; are still searching, experimenting, trying this and that.
&gt; 
&gt; Stu
