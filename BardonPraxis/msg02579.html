<pre>Dear Group,

I have been aware of the &quot;Cross of Equated Forces&quot; diagram since I 
started studying Bardon's Hermetics, but something about it has 
always bothered me. While it does nicely show the opposite 
polarities of fire and water, it doesn't show the inner polarities 
of these elements - their constructive and destructive faces. 
Thoughts about this matter, and the recent threads about &quot;good and 
evil&quot; sparked me to write this.

Imagine a piece of paper, with a vertical line dividing it into two 
halves. One half is the realm of positive fire - here fire is used 
to transform things to better forms, to provide heat, etc. The other 
half, is the realm of negative fire - here fire rages around, 
destroys and kills.
Now imagine yourself as a two-dimensional entity, living in either 
half of our piece of paper. Both kingdoms will seem as completely 
opposite to you, without any apparent relation whatsoever. You might 
be able to cross the line and visit the opposing kingdom, but you 
will never be able to see both together, as one thing.
Now, let's consider the possibility that our little entity is busy 
doing some kind of initiation process, which - the legend says - 
should enable him to experience the third dimension too, instead of 
the mere two he lives and perceives in.
One day, after considerable effort, he suddenly succeeds. He finds 
himself able to move in three-dimensional space. He starts to move 
upwards, away from his paper, and discovers a marvelous thing: both 
kingdoms are in fact just one plane, a plane of fire! Still 
digesting that discovery, he moves about space and glances at his 
paper from below. Now, he really is shocked. He discovers that not 
only is his two opposite fire-realms actually one fire-plane, this 
fire-plane has an opposite of itself, a water-plane! Even more, he 
notices that the water-plane itself is also subdivided into two 
water-realms, which the inhabitants must think as completely 
irreconcilable.
Our little entity might have two possible thoughts at this moment. 
He might think that while &quot;good-fire&quot; and &quot;bad-fire&quot; were reconciled 
into one fire, surely fire and this water which resides on the 
opposite face of the paper cannot be reconciled in any way. Or, if 
he learnt his lesson, he will understand now that if he is somehow 
able to rise even further, and see things from a four-dimensional 
perspective, even these fire and water will seem as just one thing, 
with a new opposite of itself.

The above is not meant in any way to discuss or explain the elements 
themselves, the tetrapolar magnet, or the process of initiation. Nor 
is it completely correct from a dimensional point of view - to do 
that I'd have to use lines and points instead of the two halves of 
the paper, but I felt the point is much more nicely seen this way. 
Instead, It is a metaphorical little tale representing my thoughts 
about opposites; every two such opposites can be integrated into one 
thing by &quot;looking at it from a higher dimension&quot;. That one thing, 
will again have an opposite, and the whole process will be able to 
be repeated ad infinitum. If a quantum leap is made, then perhaps all
opposites will integrate into One, this time, without any 
opposites. :)

I know that it is not a novel thought, but perhaps my idea of 
representing it using spatial dimensions will interest or help 
someone. I'm very interested in hearing your thoughts about it :)

Sincerely,
Daniel Gutmanas
