<pre>I don't think closing our eyes from our consciences is how we solve the karma 
difficulty. What we need to do is just strive to be
responsible and wise and prudent. We need to walk the middle of the road, 
tending to both sides, this is divinity. comprehending
the propriety of it is a totaly different matter. Perfect love casts away fear, 
but not because it closes eyes from danger. That's
the best I can lay it down.

Thank you Rawn and Pierre for your comments.

&gt; However, the final emotional state of terror that commercially
slaughtered animals experience does effect their flesh and as a
consequence does effect the person who eats that flesh. &lt;

In what way? Is it the physical body that's affected, or all three?

&gt; Many folks do find great value in a vegetarian diet in relation to
their spiritual quest. &lt;

In what sense? Not having tried Vegetarianism, you've aroused my
intrigue! I might give it a go! :-)

&gt;&gt; Which might leave one wondering: &quot;What *can* I eat with
impunity?&quot;. I would suggest: &quot;Anything you like!&quot;. Anyroad, I'm off
to get a Big Mac or two......... ;-) ;-) &lt;&lt;

&gt; It depends upon what you mean by impunity. Surely those two Big
Macs come with a high price to your health and to the planet in
general. Ignoring consequences is not impunity. &lt;

Sorry, I was being flippant. I'm not seriously addicted to Big
Macs..... ;-)

This is difficult for me to explain, but I'll give it a shot.....

It seems that whatever one does, there is a Karmic consequence. Kill
an animal for food: negative Karma. Take the fruit of a plant
without its permission: negative Karma.

It would seem that even the most innocuous acts can attract negative
Karma. And yet I understand that it's possible to &quot;get off&quot; the
Karmic wheel.

I'm thinking that the only way to get off the wheel is to redeem all
of one's existing Karma, and - in the process - actually do
*nothing*, so to avoid further attracting negative Karma.

This feels like a circular reference to me, so I'm sure I'm missing
something!! ;-)

The only solution I can find is this: the attraction of negative
(and, indeed, positive) Karma is more about one's *intent* rather
than one's actions. Is there any validity in this?

For example, while walking, one treads upon a blade of grass
*without* the intention of causing harm. The consequence of that
footstep is nonetheless violent..... but without the accompanying
*intent* for violence, is the Karmic return negated?

Which is what I meant by &quot;Eat anything *you* like&quot;. For if one feels
that the killing of an animal is &quot;wrong&quot; (by one's own conscience),
then one may attract negative Karma by killing/eating an animal.
However, if one's conscience is not bothered by such an act, then
perhaps killing/eating *won't* attract negative Karma.

And yet in each case, another being was murdered.

I can more comfortably accept that there is a *trigger* for Karmic
return (ie, Intent) rather than there being a vast list - somewhere
in the Universe - of all &quot;bad&quot; acts and &quot;good&quot; acts and their
respective consequences.

Sorry, I'm sure this is all tremendously complex, and best
*experienced* rather than described in words.

All the best,

Jason
