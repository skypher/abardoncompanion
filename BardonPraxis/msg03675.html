Hi Prometheus

&lt;&lt;I was wondering if any of the practitioners in the group have found 
a way to integrate some form of self-defence training into their 
Hermetic practices. Whether physical or with the use of magic. &gt;&gt;


I'm in no position to give a good answer but I do find it an 
interesting question/issue.

On the perspective that self-defence is a credible application
Of Bardons system, I'll assume this isn't off-topic.

Bardon himself gave numerous descriptions of lunar spirits that 
specialise in self-protection. And Beings of the Elements can offer 
similar aid upon request, based on my reading of second-hand 
accounts. But given that you are asking, neither suggestion is 
particularly relevant to yourself at present.

Here's a few ideas, which might encourage further discussion or 
insight, beyond what I can offer myself?

I know Rawn mentioned that Chi Kung, the practice of manipulating the 
flow of chi (aka Vital Energy) as the internal structure for the 
outward movement of Kung Fu &amp; Tai Chi martial arts, is both 
compatible and synergistic with Bardons practices.
Several members of this forum appear to be active martial artists.

A few martial artist's appear to master energies similar to the 
electric &amp; magnetic fluids for self-defence, making the chi kung 
manipulation of chi look quite basic. But that's after decades of 
consistent practice, and such advanced kung fu training is rarely 
available and not without certain risks.

With a little imagination a number of Bardon's practices could 
probably be used to paralyse an attacker, given enough practice. But 
that may require an unbalanced development (never advisable as per 
Bardon).

The triple shielding that Rawn suggests offers a type of self-
defence ? against air-borne microbes (not to be overlooked if
holding 
down full time employment!)

Karma is obviously an issue whenever physical attacks are involved. I 
can't really comment on such things but I believe Rawn mentioned
that 
the TMO practice offered the means to render certain karmic lessons a 
little less harsh. This practice conducted with your family in mind 
may well help offset any severe karmic problems sitting on the 
distant horizon (though I am speculating, best ask Rawn?)

Some attacks on people seem to occur almost because those people have 
a victim's mentality. Like as if unconscious body language is 
saying `over here, I'm a target'. Soul mirror work on
hidden 
anxieties, fears, etc., and the Step III work on the Elements, Fire 
in particular, may help to bolster the aura to avoid looking an easy 
target perhaps?

Step III &amp; Step V practitioners could probably create gemstone 
talismans with either VE or the Elements respectively, with the 
ideation of protection, and given to the loved ones as keepsakes or 
pieces of jewellery, provided they were kept on their person. (Again, 
I'm speculating?)

There are many other possibilities hidden within Bardon's
methodology 
that could perhaps be applied to self-defence, provided it is self-
defence not attack, but these few ideas might get the ball
rolling?

I wish you and your family well.

Richard
