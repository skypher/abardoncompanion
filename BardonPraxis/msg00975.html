<pre>Dear Rawn,

Now if the various spheres that Bardon talks about in his PME relate 
to the first eight sepheroth, then would it be possible to use your 
Eight Temples Meditation project as a platform for getting in contact 
with the spirits that Bardon talks about in PME? I know that while 
working within the Library of Hermes I've come across a number of 
different teachers, which I'm sure could be associated with the 72 
spirits of the Mercury zone if I had enough time to sort things out. 
Would learning as much from these teachers, and other spirits that 
exist throughout the eight temples, be a particularly good thing for 
the scholar that has not made it to step eight yet? And, consequently 
might have some difficulty discerning an independent entity from a 
relfection of one's own psyche? Or perhaps one should just go on the 
assumption that the spirit in question is part of the scholars psyche 
untill proven otherwise?

Now, if the planets are associated with the sepheroth, what of the 
planetary associations of the double letters? From which seems to 
flow that the letters are in turn associated with the sepheroth. 
Using the third key, some of the letters seem to match up: Venus(Peh) 
and Mars(Daleth) in particular. Though the others are up in the air 
for me. Or am I making the old &quot;Socrates is a duck error&quot; of Plato 
all over again?

Socrates has two legs.
Ducks have two legs.
Therefore Socrates much be a duck!

And yes, I have been working too much in the Library of Hermes. It 
shows quite blatantly that I've been studying there for years upon 
years without knowing it. One of the teachers there even went so far 
as to say to me, in not so many words, &quot;Get thee to Netzach!&quot; :) 
Which I will probably be doing sometime later this week.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist

&gt; Dear Peter,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; (1) Within Jewish Kabalah, do the sepheroth have planetary
&gt; associations? I know that the seven doubles have planetary 
associations,
&gt; but I'm not too sure about the sepheroth. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Essentially, no. But by inference, yes. It's more that the 
planets are
&gt; associated with the Sephirot than that the Sephirot are associated 
with
&gt; the planets.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; (2) When Bardon talks about the Eathsphere, Moonsphere, et al, 
is he
&gt; talking about the various sepheroth of the tree of life? &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Yes! :) :) :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; (3) Exactly how important is sequence within the various steps?
&gt; Personally I was working through the step three mental exercises 
upon
&gt; the imagry of the tarot card of the World. While doing as such I was
&gt; suddenly 'sucked' into the image of the woman within the tarot card,
&gt; and started to experience the tarot card from the perspective of 
this
&gt; woman, complete with all of the physiological and emotional
&gt; experiences. In addition to the knowledge of what the imagry of this
&gt; woman is all about. And so on and so forth. This would seem to be
&gt; diving really deep into the step four exercises and does show how 
the
&gt; exercises of one step flow seamlessly into the next... &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; There is a big difference between a spontaneous experience such as
&gt; you've described and being able to accomplish the same thing by act 
of
&gt; will and with intention and consistency. This is where adhering to 
the
&gt; sequence comes into play.
&gt; 
&gt; We each incarnate with unique abilities and many of these emerge 
during
&gt; the Bardon work. This doesn't however, mean that those native 
abilities
&gt; don't need further training in order to become reliable faculties.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; (4) On the subject of sequence, within your commentary, Rawn, 
you say
&gt; that there is a long and complicated reason for why Bardon puts the
&gt; exercises in the sequence that he does. Primarily in association 
with
&gt; the sequence of the elements and senses that are worked upon. So, 
care
&gt; to put forth the long and complicated reasons for this? &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; No, not particularly. It would be too convoluted for me to write it
&gt; clearly at present (and too time consuming).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; (5) When you create an good visualization, it naturally creates a
&gt; connection with the astral counterpart of what is being visualized,
&gt; correct? Now from my experience this connection can be used to 
create
&gt; a transference of consciousness. However, I'm not quite sure how to
&gt; create a transference of consciousness with an object that is before
&gt; the eyes as it where. Which, again, seems to go against the line of
&gt; progression within step four that Bardon puts forth within step 
four. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; With a visualization, you have the advantage of already 
being &quot;inside&quot;
&gt; it since you are, in effect, creating the visualization around your
&gt; center of awareness. With the transference into a non-self-created
&gt; thing, you must externalize your awareness and then relocate your
&gt; awareness into the thing. This is only slightly different than
&gt; relocating your focus to your own foot, for example.
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
