<pre>Dear David,

Perhaps instead of thinking of it at as &quot;projecting energy&quot;, think of it as
charging like you would charge a battery. You are influencing the
surrounding energy with your idea, not projecting your own charged energy.
Then you breathe in this charged air, which flows through your blood stream
like a circuit, and powers your spirit with the charged idea. Then you
breathe out the uncharged (or negatively charged) air to be re-charged
again.

If you are having trouble accepting change, then perhaps you may need to
work on that first?

Blessings,
PAUL

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Allen,
&gt; 
&gt; That kind of confuses me, because in Rawn's Commentary he says that
&gt; this exercise is not pranayama and not about etheric energy ... I
&gt; have no doubt that breathing exercises can cultivate this but my
&gt; understanding is that the Step One exercise is not about that.
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, I think I am having problems setting aside resistance to
&gt; replacing qualities in myself. If I try to inhale peace, I find that
&gt; a part of me is attached to staying the way I am. I think some of
&gt; the problem may be in the way I am conceptualizing the exercise; I
&gt; feel like when I project my desire outward, I am leaving myself
&gt; deficient of that energy, so that projecting it out and breathing it
&gt; back in becomes a limited cycle. The core of it is that at some
&gt; level I can't let go of my fears and my attachment to my negative
&gt; trait.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions on this?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; David

&gt; &gt; Hi David,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Conscious Breathing is used by manipulating prana by
&gt; &gt; way of the akasha. What happens is that you impregnate
&gt; &gt; a small portion of that prana and then allow into to
&gt; &gt; pass into your physical, astral, and mental bodies.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you dig deeper into the practice of pranayama,
&gt; &gt; you'll be doing yourself a big favor. Pranayama is
&gt; &gt; much more than a few healthy breathing exercises if
&gt; &gt; done correctly. It can be an extremely powerful boost
&gt; &gt; to magical exercises and is very magical in itself.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Start by reading the Science of Breath. I believe Rawn
&gt; &gt; Clark put the .pdf under the files.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Don't take exercises like Conscious Breathing lightly.
&gt; &gt; Don't take my word for it - dig a bit deeper and you
&gt; &gt; will see exactly what I mean. Many people report after
&gt; &gt; some pranayama practice they begin to actually see the
&gt; &gt; prana in the ether (this was even in someone's post
&gt; &gt; recently). Working with ideas and prana is certainly
&gt; &gt; very different than just letting it remain inside you.
&gt; &gt; There are many secrets to breathing. :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sincerely,
&gt; &gt; Allen Kray

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure my conceptualization of this exercise
&gt; &gt; &gt; is correct, so I'd
&gt; &gt; &gt; like to ask for some feedback ... To my
&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding, first you
&gt; &gt; &gt; imagine your wish so strongly that it is as if it
&gt; &gt; &gt; were real. Then
&gt; &gt; &gt; you invest it in the air around you, and finally you
&gt; &gt; &gt; breathe in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; air and let the ideation flow through you.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; My confusion is that, in this conceptualization, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems like you
&gt; &gt; &gt; are starting with a feeling inside you, projecting
&gt; &gt; &gt; it outward, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; bringing it back in. Why isn't it more efficient to
&gt; &gt; &gt; just let it
&gt; &gt; &gt; remain inside you, instead of putting it in the air?
