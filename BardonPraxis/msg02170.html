<pre>Hi Allen,

That kind of confuses me, because in Rawn's Commentary he says that 
this exercise is not pranayama and not about etheric energy ... I 
have no doubt that breathing exercises can cultivate this but my 
understanding is that the Step One exercise is not about that.

Overall, I think I am having problems setting aside resistance to 
replacing qualities in myself. If I try to inhale peace, I find that 
a part of me is attached to staying the way I am. I think some of 
the problem may be in the way I am conceptualizing the exercise; I 
feel like when I project my desire outward, I am leaving myself 
deficient of that energy, so that projecting it out and breathing it 
back in becomes a limited cycle. The core of it is that at some 
level I can't let go of my fears and my attachment to my negative 
trait.

Any suggestions on this?


Thanks,
David

&gt; Hi David,
&gt; 
&gt; Conscious Breathing is used by manipulating prana by
&gt; way of the akasha. What happens is that you impregnate
&gt; a small portion of that prana and then allow into to
&gt; pass into your physical, astral, and mental bodies. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you dig deeper into the practice of pranayama,
&gt; you'll be doing yourself a big favor. Pranayama is
&gt; much more than a few healthy breathing exercises if
&gt; done correctly. It can be an extremely powerful boost
&gt; to magical exercises and is very magical in itself.
&gt; 
&gt; Start by reading the Science of Breath. I believe Rawn
&gt; Clark put the .pdf under the files.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't take exercises like Conscious Breathing lightly.
&gt; Don't take my word for it - dig a bit deeper and you
&gt; will see exactly what I mean. Many people report after
&gt; some pranayama practice they begin to actually see the
&gt; prana in the ether (this was even in someone's post
&gt; recently). Working with ideas and prana is certainly
&gt; very different than just letting it remain inside you.
&gt; There are many secrets to breathing. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Allen Kray

&gt; &gt; I'm not sure my conceptualization of this exercise
&gt; &gt; is correct, so I'd 
&gt; &gt; like to ask for some feedback ... To my
&gt; &gt; understanding, first you 
&gt; &gt; imagine your wish so strongly that it is as if it
&gt; &gt; were real. Then 
&gt; &gt; you invest it in the air around you, and finally you
&gt; &gt; breathe in the 
&gt; &gt; air and let the ideation flow through you.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My confusion is that, in this conceptualization, it
&gt; &gt; seems like you 
&gt; &gt; are starting with a feeling inside you, projecting
&gt; &gt; it outward, and 
&gt; &gt; bringing it back in. Why isn't it more efficient to
&gt; &gt; just let it 
&gt; &gt; remain inside you, instead of putting it in the air?
