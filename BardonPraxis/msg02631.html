<tt>Greets. In regards to your missive.. I believe the 'masculine' becomes more 
apparent in the doing. Doing in the outter w/o proper balance in the inner, 
may only lead to a more juvenile acting out of the masculine. Proper 
'masculine' does not act out to demonstrate to itself its potency, even 
though were are all tempted to do so (as well as the feminine/female 
juvenile acts of selfishness).</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>It is the &quot;will &quot;manifesting as self-discipline inner and outter that may be 
the 'hidden' or 'not so apparent' masculine (classical) force that you are 
looking for evidence of. Perhaps its been there all the time, and simply not 
perceived? It is most strongly there.. yet perhaps not acting out obviously 
for demonstration.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I think the masculine &quot;act&quot; becomes obviously apparent when in reponse to 
the inner knowing. Much like a man responding to the needs of a woman and 
family.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>He cannot serve the needs of the others completely if his feminine is ONLY 
sought in the woman's obovious association, it must be balanced within him 
as his own.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Think of it as a birth of a male/active/mascliine force child from the 
healthy and balanced feminine inner womb.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>The masculine force becomes obvious in the will which is being constantly 
developed in the Bardon lessons.</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Thanks.

<tt>ps - male apologetics are unecessary. You are coming from a place of 
respectfullness. Equals speak to each other as if to themselves and from a 
loving respectful place. I believe the time for male apologetics is coming 
to an end.</tt><br>

&amp;gt;Good afternoon dear colleagues.<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt;For some time I have been thinking about the Feminine / Masculine<br>
&amp;gt;axis of polarity and about Balance. I have hesitated to bring this up<br>
&amp;gt;for fear of causing offense where none is intended. Nevertheless a<br>
&amp;got;question not asked is wisdom forgone. So . . .<br>
&amp;gt;Can't learn if you don't ask.<br>
&amp;gt;It seems to me that Hermetics as described in IIH and as discussed in<br>
&amp;gt;this list is a little skewed towards the Feminine pole.<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt;I agree, some might say that is because _Evocation_ leans so strongly to 
the 'Active' pole. I'm not sure of that entirely myself.<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt; Much of the<br>
&amp;gt;emphasis is on meditation, passive observation of inner states, and<br>
&amp;gt;learning &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot; in a higher sense of the concept.<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt; All of which are important lessons for a Magickian, and unexplained 
and undeveloped in other published 19th &amp;amp; 20th Century Sources (ie 
Crowley, Regardie, etc) which is why Bardon is so important for Hermeticism. 
Crowley mentions it but never bothers to teach it, nor do most after him.<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt; Although Bardon<br>
&amp;gt;describes the actual doing of magick it doesn't seem to get as much<br>
&amp;gt;emphasis as the more receptive exercises. Certainly on this list I<br>
&amp;gt;don't read much about summoning power, casting spells, and making<br>
&amp;gt;things happen out in the world - in other words, I don't hear much<br>
&amp;gt;about the Masculine aspects of Hermetics.<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt;Mayhaps you are right, or it is in book 2. Or it could be that some 
other exercises should be done by each student to balance them, LBRP &amp;amp; 
MPE from the Golden Dawn being the best known; but Ogdoadic, Thelemic, or 
other versions serve the same purpose.<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt;Is the focus of our discussions out of balance or (perhaps) is the<br>
&amp;gt;focus deliberately skewed towards the Feminine to compensate for a<br>
&amp;gt;culture that favors the Masculine?<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt;Maybe he assumed the beginning Hermetic student already was doing the 
exercises above?<br>

&amp;gt;Frater Serpentis Satori<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt;Sincerely, /RM/<br>
&amp;gt;<br>
&amp;gt;P.S. Please note that I am talking about Feminine / Masculine in the<br>
&amp;gt;esoteric sense - I'm not referring to specific traits of female /<br>
&amp;gt;male members of the human species.<br>
