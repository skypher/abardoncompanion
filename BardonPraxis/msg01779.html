&gt; Hi David,
&gt; 
&gt; All interesting and true - but it may be useful to note that
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I have had to learn from being with them -- things like, 
&gt; learning how to lie about myself without showing it&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; This is still lying ;-) By looking at your positive traits in the 
soul mirror, there should be a way you can adapt the negative aspect 
of lying and replace it with a positive one, so that when presented 
with a situation you feel you need to &quot;lie and not show it&quot; you can 
use this traits opposite! This will yield a similar intention, but 
give you a chance to creatively emply more of your positive elements!
&gt; 
&gt; I have also personally found that protecting yourself from other 
peoples negative / violent emotions is not so beneficial as embracing 
them and using them as a means of exercising restraint and loving 
kindness towards those encumbered with such emotions and helping them 
overcome the need for them. Good for the soul ;-)

&gt; I was talking with my fiancee today about the reasons I didn't like 
&gt; being with my parents and extended family. As I was listing the 
&gt; things I have had to learn from being with them -- things like, 
&gt; learning how to lie about myself without showing it, to protect 
&gt; myself from others' violent emotions, etc. -- I realized that 
despite 
&gt; the negativity of my experiences, the resulting traits are actually 
&gt; quite positive. I had been kind of blocked on progress in working 
on 
&gt; my positive soul mirror, and I realized that I have been mainly 
&gt; trying to list traits I observe in myself when things are going 
&gt; smoothly, and that many if not most positive traits are the ones 
that 
&gt; are developed to help us survive and thrive in challenging 
&gt; situations. Very interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have a question, but I just thought I would share. I hope 
&gt; this isn't going off-topic.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; David


Not that I disagree with the above, but I don't think one lie's in 
response to anothjer's person's negativity. Instead to one's own that 
one projects onto others. In other words, one lies to protect one 
from the criticism one would lay on someone else. One lies to please 
one's inner snob.
