Please elaborate on this Jason;

&quot;My only other comment on the whole process so far is that the 
mental helps with the astral. As in, once you get good at Thought 
Discipline you can meditate on the tetragrammaton itself and its 
significance, and then be constantly aware, ...&quot;

As to your other comments... that seems to be a great ideal you've 
reached, being able to rephrase the negative to a positive; &quot;What 
would I have to have been feeling/believing/thinking/etc. to have 
acted differently?' And the cool thing is if you phrase it like that 
it's always a positive, never negative. Then breathe that in and 
just be confident you've changed.&quot; 

I agree, we are all such different 'planets' in our own galaxy when 
you view us from the character/personality. Think of it, nobody has 
any of the same situation in their early growing years. We may all 
have one parent, two parents, but we have a different family friend 
who always has an impact on us for instance. So we are each unique 
and different in our approaches and what may be a key to one... etc.

I wish you well
Chuck

&gt; Hey Chuck,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;Then I take that thought 
&gt; to sleep with me to be worked on in the subconscious as I 
impregnate 
&gt; the opposite characteristic from the negative and it works....
&gt; There are many fine tools to deal with negating the negative 
trait, 
&gt; also I find that I spend time inbreathing the Divine virtue that 
is 
&gt; the opposite of the negative trait.&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That all sounds good to me too. I agree that the tools provided 
are very 
&gt; good and effective even in step 1. In fact I sometimes find myself 
in the 
&gt; paradoxical position of why bother to progress! I also think 
Bardon's genius was in 
&gt; writing something so infinitely flexible and yet so definite. We 
all start 
&gt; from such different places.
&gt; 
&gt; My only other comment on the whole process so far is that the 
mental helps 
&gt; with the astral. As in, once you get good at Thought Discipline 
you can 
&gt; meditate on the tetragrammaton itself and its significance, and 
then be constantly 
&gt; aware, initiate a kind of rolling program of mirror work, doesn't 
even need to 
&gt; be written down in a way, of observing its operation in your 
life. Can all 
&gt; sort of be noted as you go and even start to be corrected on the 
spot day to 
&gt; day. I find that really helpful. Life gets to be your mirror.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't find the whole 'opposite characteristic' thing works for 
me so well 
&gt; though. As in, you felt fear so you breathe in courage - because 
it seems too 
&gt; general.... do you know what I mean? What I feel works best 
personally is 
&gt; really like one of those old 'choose your own adventure' books - 
where you took 
&gt; what seems a wrong turn. You turn back and see what you should 
have done. It a
&gt; ll kind of comes down to knowing what one should do but being 
afraid of 
&gt; opening oneself to love - fear and love seem like the uber-fault 
and uber-virtue 
&gt; if you like.
&gt; 
&gt; So I kind of ask myself the question, 'What would I have to have 
been 
&gt; feeling/believing/thinking/etc. to have acted differently?' And 
the cool thing is 
&gt; if you phrase it like that it's always a positive, never negative. 
Then 
&gt; breathe that in and just be confident you've changed. This way 
your life becomes a 
&gt; story you're writing. Which is like saying, until you do step 1-3 
life is 
&gt; writing you!
&gt; 
&gt; It reminds me a bit of what Rawn describes in the 'Centre of 
Stillness' 
&gt; meditation, where you lift yourself up and look down and see all 
the threads of 
&gt; your life, and you can reposition them. I seem to understand these 
threads as 
&gt; stories that one is involved in. It helps too with all the 
grading, of what 
&gt; you want to tackle 1st etc., especially with a problem I keep 
having which is 
&gt; wanting to solve it all, *now*! That could be described as a 
change of tone 
&gt; in the narrator's voice maybe, as in I need to learn to tell 
myself the story 
&gt; of myself as calmly as possible! But I love reading and stories 
so this is why 
&gt; it works this way for me. In general I think whatever one loves 
is going to 
&gt; be helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; best to you, Jason
