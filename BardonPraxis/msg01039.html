<pre>Dear M.,

&gt;&gt; Does this mean that at some stage in your development you turn onto a
permanent cannabis like trip? &lt;&lt;

;-) Not exactly, no. One distinct difference is the fact that with
cannabis (or any other such mind altering substance), you can't turn the
heightened perception and mental functioning, on and off at will.
Unless, that is, you've developed very strong mental discipline.

&gt;&gt; Also, does anybody know how this plant could help Magic studies? - I
am thinking about trying it. &lt;&lt;

The planetary associations of this herb are Venus and Mercury, which
well describes its ability to pleasantly ease open the mind and create a
certain harmony between emotion and rational intellect. This can lead
to either positive or negative effects. For example, it can inspire
your mind or it can put you in a stupor.

Which pole it manifests depends upon many factors, foremost of which is
the nature of the individual ingesting it. The effects of cannabis upon
the human body vary greatly from person to person and from strain to
strain. Some strains of cannabis WILL put you in a stupor, no matter
what! ;-) And other strains will barely effect your body, while vastly
liberating your mind.

The living cannabis plant itself is very intelligent and highly
sensitive to the &quot;vibe&quot; surrounding it. It has a great affinity for
humanity and has been used by human beings for unknown thousands of
years, as everything from food, to clothing, to medicine. It's only
been over the past several decades that it has been grown under some
pretty bizarre conditions and often with all kinds of nasty chemicals
involved. All of these things change the herb from its pristine state
due to its intelligence and sensitivity. [The primary psychoactive
parts of the cannabis flower are housed in a crystalline form, which is
ideal for capturing &quot;vibes&quot;, so to speak.] So it's important (for
magical use) to ingest only organically grown cannabis, preferably grown
outdoors with loving care.

While cannabis offers many good attributes, the main negative in terms
of magical training, is the issue of not being able to turn its effect
on and off at will. During the training, it's *vitally* important that
you learn how to reach the mental states you need to reach *on your own,
by your own will and not become dependant upon cannabis as a crutch to
reach those states*.

This is especially important during the Step One mental exercises. If
you do these while you still have the effects of cannabis in your
system, then you will not be observing your *normal* state of mind in
the first exercise; will not be gaining control over your *normal* state
of mind (which has a few different rules than the mind on cannabis!) in
the second exercise; and will not learn how to reach a VOM from a
*normal* state of mind in the third exercise.

It can also interfere with the development of the Step Two, sensory
concentrations. These exercises really must be mastered with the
normally functioning mind, otherwise a dependence upon the cannabis can
easily develop and you'll find yourself unable to visualize, audiolize,
etc., when you're not high.

But once you've achieved strong mental discipline, this is not so much
of an issue so long as you do learn to master the exercises without the
help of the cannabis.

I find Cannabis to be a very friendly, pleasant and beneficial herb. It
is not however, a replacement for hard work, nor is it a short cut.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
