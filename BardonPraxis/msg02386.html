<pre>Dear Rawn,

Thank you very much for your reply. Well, it is not my intention, in any
way, to initiate here a polemic about the importance of Aleister Crowley in
the contemporary occultism because this forum is about the teachings of
Franz Bardon.
In any case, I would say that you musn&#xB4;t be worry because you haven&#xB4;t
offended
my own set of beliefs, simplely because I am NOT a disciple of Aleister
Crowley in ANY form. So don&#xB4;t worry about that! :)
But trying to be honest to myself, I think that Crowley is, undoubtly, one
of the most interesting, fascinating and influential magickal minds of the
20th century, in other words, a genius. To me, there&#xB4;s no doubt about
this.Yes, he was a very damage person: addicted to drugs, manipulator of the
persons, extremely arrogant, insincere, etc. But in my opinion, his &quot;good
side&quot; musn&#xB4;t be underestimated: an extraordinary intelligence, the more
higher erudition, and an incredible talent and ability for magick. If
someone wants to write a history of the occult arts, in any way can ignore
the name of Aleister Crowley. It is impossible. That would be like writing a
history of &quot;academic&quot; philosophy with the exclusion of Plat&#xF3;n, Arist&#xF3;teles
or
Friedrich Nietzsche. In that sense I said that it&#xB4;s &quot;inevitable&quot; for &quot;all&quot;
the students of the occult remembering to Aleister Crowley. If you are
sceptical about the influence of Crowley, you only have to take a look to
many of the nicknames and e-mail adresses of some persons of this forum; you
will find in them very clearly a crowleian reminiscence.
You say that the phrase &quot;Love is the Law, Love under Will&quot; is not original
to Crowley. Well, but then, whose is the original author? I know that
P.B.Randolph, a predecessor of Crowley had a similar phrase: &quot;Will reigns
Omnipotent; Love lieth at the Foundation&quot;. Did you refer to Randolph when
you said that Crowley is not the original author? In any case, what Bardon
proclaims in IIH is not the Randolph&#xB4;s formulation of the phrase. He says
clearly, as you know, &quot;Love is the law, but love under a strong will&quot; (I
translate directly from the spanish edition, literally).
Of course I am in total accord with you when you say that the genuine
hermetic initiation musn&#xB4;t be about following the &quot;revelations&quot; of other
people. I have absolutely no doubt about that.

Well, Rawn, thank you very much for your patience, help and attention!!!!!
;)

Dear Joa,

&gt;&gt; I think that today it&#xB4;s inevitable for all the students of the
occult to remember that exactly one hundred years ago (on 8th April
1904), a young man called Aleister Crowley began to receive a
supposed revelation in El Cairo (Egypt) from Aiwass, his Holy
Guardian Angel: The Book of the Law. &lt;&lt;

While I don't mean to offend your own set of beliefs, you have
greatly overstated when you use the words &quot;inevitable&quot; and &quot;all&quot; in
this context. :)

&gt;&gt; It seems that Bardon had a great respect for &quot;The Great Beast&quot;
because there&#xB4;s a passage in IIH that has clearly the crowleian
influence: &quot;Love is the Law, Love under Will&quot;. Bardon wrote this, but
curiously he didn&#xB4;t make any
mention about Crowley. &lt;&lt;

That phrase is not original to Crowley. But even if he was in fact
quoting Crowley, there's no indication of exactly how Bardon felt
about Crowley.

&gt;&gt; I haven&#xB4;t got very clear what is the &quot;bardonist&quot;:) attitude on
Crowley. Did Bardon believe in the authenticity of that &quot;revelation&quot;?
What was really his opinion about Crowley and what was the real
grade of influence of Crowley on Bardon in the creation of IIH? &lt;&lt;

Bardon didn't say.

&gt;&gt; Rawn, I have observed that you don&#xB4;t make any mention on Crowley
(for example in your &quot;anotated bibliography&quot; there is not any book of
Crowley. To me, this is highly surprising because his influence on
FB is evident, like I said before). Do you consider him a black
magician? What is your personal opinion about him and his system of
training? Can you clarify me these points? &lt;&lt;

Personally, I find no value in Crowley's writings and I do not see
any &quot;evidence&quot; of his influence upon Bardon's system.

Hermetic initiation as Bardon presented it is not about following
another person's revelation. Instead, it is about empowering the
student's own abilities to attain their own personal &quot;revelations&quot;.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
