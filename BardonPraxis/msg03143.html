<pre>Dear Micheline, et al,

&gt;&gt; I have come acoss this site which expands on Angels as per Bardon's
work........ anyone familiar with this body of work? a channeling it
seems, origu=inally from a psychic named Cyntia Rose &lt;&lt;

This work has no actual foundation in fact other than relying upon the
facts that Bardon wrote about the entities of the Earth zone. But even
those facts have been so thwarted by imagination that they are of no
true value as presented here. If you look closely at these writings and
compare them to Bardon's notes, what is apparent is that the author has
taken Bardon's words and then integrated her understanding of astrology
and her own &quot;spiritual&quot; philosophy but has not provided any
*experience-derived* information about these entities.

In other words, it *sounds* pretty but it doesn't add to what *Bardon*
wrote and, in fact, seems quite contrary to the spirit of Bardon's PME.
The point of PME was to aid the magician in developing their own
abilities in regard to evocation and to forward their initiation, not to
present them with fairy tales that entertain the emotions alone.
Bardonian evocation is *serious* work that depends upon well developed
faculties of perception. As I've said many times before, the grimoir
included in PME is the *least* important part of the book.

Furthermore -- and this is *very* important -- as Emil Stejnar pointed
out, Bardon used a code for all of the Earth zone names. Had the author
of these writings actually made contact with these entities, she would
have know this fact. But she did not and she compounded this
misinformation by using the names, as printed but not decoded, to
compose a little section on the meaning behind the letters in each name.
If you compare her words in those sections to what Bardon wrote in KTQ
regarding the meanings of the letters in each of the four realms
(Akashic, mental, astral and physical), you will see that she is just
paraphrasing Bardon's own words. She even went so far as to look up the
tonal correspondences to those letters in her copy of KTQ and labeled
this the spirit's &quot;melody&quot;.

In my opinion (for whatever it's worth), in the context of Bardon's
serious work, this is useless pap.

Discernment is an important faculty for the aspiring Hermetic magician
and it must be continuously strengthened. In a recent thread someone
brought up the idea of observing where a negative character trait or a
difficulty originates within the self. This same basic technique can
(and perhaps, should) be applied in a case such as this. As you read
Ms. Rose's work, ask yourself at which level of yourself does this
writing strike a chord . . .

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
