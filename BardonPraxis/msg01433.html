<pre>Greetings;

Personally I've worked with my chackras and now am working with the
Kaballa within myself. 

The chackras of the eastern systems are using the middle path of the
Kaballa. Root/sexual/clan, social, energy, love/heart, intellect/mind,
psychic and lastly spiritual chackras. In the Kaballa, the western
hermetic system there is Malkut/Earthing, Yesod/inner dream astral
realm, Tiphereth, heart/beauty, and Kether, original essence. The
middle path.

I have expressed these in this way to show in this comparisson that
there is no inter-related mapping of the two systems. Including the
other two pillars, mercy and severity, have nothing to do with the two
paths being similar in any way. Any similiarity is simply not possible
to make along this line of thought. The only similarity of the two
systems is that the middle path of Kaballa and the chackras system
both have to do with the electrical/fluid/chemical/magnetic path of
following the spinal cord system throughout the body. At these places
along the spine there are nexus (major groupings) of nerve branches
which the practitioner allows for the feeling of occuring along the
spind and forward of the spine to the front of the body about three
inches. This location is where the practitioner &quot;feels&quot; the location
of the energies involved in locating in those areas for that
Chackras/Sephirot(Kaballa). 

Once the practitioner locates these centers by allowing through faith
and belief and centered concentration on the area it becomes obvious
that the areas do not correlate to any actual physical organ except
that they root from the spinal cord directly. 

So, that is the feeling of centering concentration on those areas.

It is mixing apples and oranges to bring this fact into the discussion
of what Bardon is discussing in the IIH discussions of focused
concentrated meditation on specific areas of the body. Bardon is
speaking specifically about generating gathered/concentrated energies
to actual physical organs of the body, be they muscles, bones, skin,
nerves, stomache, spleen, heart, brain, etc. One may generate energies
in all of the specific singular areas of the body, organs and all
&quot;EXCEPT&quot; the heart muscle and the brain neuro mass. That is all he is
cautioning about. 

When one concentrates on collecting specific energies into the organ
of the heart it will conflict with the natural electric/magnetic
functioning of the actual organ. The same with the brain neuro mass.
So, instead of concentrating actual energies into the organ
specifically he is directing the wise practitioner to caution and to
instead focus energy into the general area. This difference alone, the
general area instead of the specific organ is enough to make all of
the difference in the world, in the practioners life. So, one
meditates in the area below the end of the sternum, which is about 2
to three inches to the right of the heart, or one meditates on the
entire chest area. Both methods &quot;exclude&quot; direct concentrated energies
from the heart muscle itself. The same with the brain, one practices
attracting energies to the neck, the skin, the scalp, the ears, the
eyes, the nose, the muscles of the mouth and cheeks, forehead,
&quot;instead&quot; of concentrating energies into the mass of neuro mass of the
brain itself. 

What the caution is all about is like giving a caution of not pouring
a can of gasoline onto a burning fire. You will simply probably burn
yourself up. 

As to the heart chackras one would do best to concentrate using a
specific system of eastern teaching and follow it explicitly. The same
with the western hermetic sciences, choose one system and follow it
completely. It becomes difficult in working with two systems at once.
I know, theoretically since the subject is the same one single human
being in all systems, they ought to correlate in different cultures,
equalling about the same because simply the same body system is being
worked upon. But this is not the case, as different cultures bring an
entirely different set of working tools to the same workshop. They
accomplish the same results, just using different tools and setting up
the workshop differently.

If your concern is the heart chackras I would suggest you choose and
follow a specific system. Find out within and for yourself where on
the spinal column you &quot;feel&quot;/find the energies of the heart chackras,
and follow it out to where it generates heat in your chest. Both the
root in the nerve ganglion nexus on on the spine and the blossoming
sphere of energy in the chest are the heart chackra. The same with the
other chackras.

I Wish You Well,
Chuck
