Ardeshire,

I hope I didn't scare you. A lot of people become scared 
when talking about occult matters. I have introduced the Bardon's 
Books to others who invoked an interest in the occult and they have 
found his books quite informative. As for Occult orders, they have 
their advantages and disadvantages. I would suggest researching the 
matter more thoroughly. Gandalf's magic from &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; I 
feel could have been a bit more spectacular, but it truth, I think it 
told the story of WW-1 or 2; I am not sure. Anyhow, it was wonderful 
that they made a Movie from the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series of 
books. In regards to Magical Orders/Societies, I am not a 
participant so that matter I am not able to give you any information 
on. On the whole, I do not wish to influence you in anyway to 
practice magic; I feel it is a personal matter for one to decide 
because once the door is open; it's hard to close it again.  
Remember, you are dealing with the human consciousness, never 
underestimate it; it is very powerful; too powerful comprehend.  
There are people who have walked the path without any guidance and 
fell by the wayside. Some people think that making a chair fly in 
air or making something disappear and reappear is what real magic is 
all about, but I think that they will find that it is not so. I feel 
that magic makes up aware of who we are, why we are here, and shows 
us how we can improve upon ourselves for the better. I am not saying 
that there isn't the dark-side because there is a dark side to 
magic. Just as there are (-)Negative and (+)Positive poles. So, if 
I might ask you, are your main interests in magic for the improvement 
of yourself or for attaining worldly possessions and pleasures? I 
feel that question should be thought out thoroughly before starting 
your engine and proceeding forward. Again, I hope I haven't scared 
you.

Barry

&gt; Thanks for your reply and for your help. Others like Rawn believe 
&gt; that all the abilities in the Bardon books are possible, but I've 
&gt; also heard the same as your's from many other sources. For instance 
&gt; from Wiccan books and sites I've read that the usual feats we think 
&gt; of when we think of magic aren't true and magic to them more 
subtle. 
&gt; Probably something like Gandalf's magic as opposed to the emperor's 
&gt; lightening projections in Star Wars.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm aslo interested in the idea of a magical society if the one's 
&gt; who have the attained the most would help others. Bardon mentions 
&gt; the idea in Frabato the Magician where he talks about the FOGC 
lodge 
&gt; trying to discredit the idea of the occult and the fear of what the 
&gt; change in society that would result if occult knowledge was common. 
&gt; Eventhough Bardon intended his books to take the place of teachers 
I 
&gt; think most people would benefit from teaching and might actually 
&gt; need it. Because most times not everyone can learn on their own.

&gt; &gt; First off, I can only tell you of my own experiences with the 
&gt; system, 
&gt; &gt; but I cannot speak for the others, only for myself. As you were 
&gt; &gt; astounded and overwhelmed by all the possibilities so was I at 
the 
&gt; &gt; beginning. However, as I started traveling along the path of the 
&gt; &gt; unknown, other things made themselves known to my mind's eye. I 
&gt; &gt; started to see the world differently from the way other people 
saw 
&gt; &gt; it. I must say, at first, I found the experiences astounding and 
&gt; an 
&gt; &gt; eye opening experience. There are other powers at play here.  
&gt; Powers 
&gt; &gt; which others don't wish to speak of; I don't know ? I guess out 
of 
&gt; &gt; fear which is the mind killer ? for fear can diminish a person 
&gt; &gt; abilities swiftly. I am sure you have had such experiences when 
&gt; &gt; approaching a matter(s) with fear. Let me start answering your 
&gt; &gt; questions: You want to know if the abilities presented in the 
&gt; Bardon 
&gt; &gt; Books were attainable. I would say some of them are, but if you 
&gt; are 
&gt; &gt; expecting &quot;Mandrake the Magician spectaculars,&quot; then I would say 
&gt; no.  
&gt; &gt; I feel to attain some of the possibilities in Bardon's system 
&gt; there 
&gt; &gt; are certain requirements one should be willing to meet, unless 
the 
&gt; &gt; individual is a natural like the Frabato, which I am not. All 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; clairvoyance stuff is true. I for one have witnessed foreseen 
&gt; events 
&gt; &gt; in horror and was not able to do anything to about it; astral 
&gt; travel 
&gt; &gt; is also true; the reincarnation stuff also true. I really don't 
&gt; know 
&gt; &gt; if Bardon was Lao Tse and the others; I have never tested that 
&gt; area 
&gt; &gt; of Bardon's life and I don't like to take a person's words as the 
&gt; &gt; final revelation, testament and judgment on the matter. As for 
&gt; &gt; possibilities of making an imagination appear to the physical 
eyes 
&gt; or 
&gt; &gt; imagined sound to the hearing; all that is possible. In regards 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; money, I have tested those waters, and I would be careful. Bear 
&gt; in 
&gt; &gt; mind, money is a man-made device by design. Remember, for every 
&gt; &gt; cause there is an effect; causality. Make sure you do your 
&gt; research 
&gt; &gt; before testing the uncharted waters of moneymaking using magic.  
&gt; As 
&gt; &gt; for the &quot;making gold thing&quot;, I would give up on that. There are 
&gt; only 
&gt; &gt; a few, real McCoy, Alchemist, remaining on our world and they 
&gt; refuse 
&gt; &gt; to let themselves be known. It would be nice if someone out there 
&gt; who 
&gt; &gt; would be brave enough to write a simplified version of magical 
&gt; &gt; steps/attainments, thus cutting away all the areas of &quot;enigmas&quot; 
&gt; which 
&gt; &gt; has stalled many of us on the path of our magical evolution.  
It's 
&gt; &gt; just like the age of the typewriter vs. the computer; are we 
&gt; willing 
&gt; &gt; to make that change?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as long as I achieve basic results I can know that the 
&gt; whole 
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing is real and it's just a matter of time to reach the other 
&gt; &gt; &gt; abilities. That's basically all I need to get to.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; What have you been able to achieve and how did you do it, and 
&gt; also 
&gt; &gt; &gt; how long did it take?
