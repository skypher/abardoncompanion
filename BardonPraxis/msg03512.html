William Bloom mentions what he calls &quot;heavies&quot; in his book (in the 
form of a ceremonail diary) &quot;The Sacred Magician&quot;. He seems to have 
experienced these negative presences during prayer and meditation 
and also during sleep. Bloom performed the ritual described in &quot;The 
Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage&quot;.

Here are a few extracts from the book - do these descriptions ring a 
bell?

&quot;I felt a strong malevolent presence trying to interfere, tempting 
me with lazy peace and power if I should become his friend. He 
departed after five seconds. I do not know whether this is a good or 
bad start. I am torn apart and everything is in a sort of senseless 
limbo - but my head behind all this keeps on smiling. (NOTE BY 
AUTHOR: Throughout the six months I often experienced what I 
interpreted as malevolent energies. I did not see or hear them, but 
felt them.)&quot;

&quot;Shortly after I went to sleep last night, I was attacked(?) by an 
astral entity that seemed to try to enter my body - a feeling of 
suffocation and smothering. I was not frightened for one second and 
dismissed it by affirming my faith in our Lord Christ. However, had 
I been cooler I would have found out what it was. I wonder whether 
it is in any way linked with our guest [...] Or was it purely a test 
on me or something I alone attracted? Somehow I do not feel that it 
was dangerous - more lost and sad - perhaps I should have been 
gentler with it.&quot;

He also describes a psychic war with Hilter during one night!

Now, I don't know what all this means or what these entities 
described might be. Are they part of one's own psyche? Are they 
separate entities? Is it all simply a matter of perception?

&gt; I was wondering if anyone has ever experienced a sensation of a
&gt; oppressive/threatening presence while in meditation,or relaxed,i
&gt; experienced something very unusual recently a feeling of something
&gt; coming up close to me and covering me pushing on me,i even for a
&gt; second felt a slip into unconcioussness but came right out,i just
&gt; focused my &quot;will&quot; on pushing it out of my awareness and after a few
&gt; minutes it did.this isn't the first time i'v experienced the sense 
of
&gt; a negative presence a few times i'v even opend my eyes to see dark
&gt; figures where i felt the presence from.oddly anuff bardon doesn't 
say
&gt; anything about this in the initial aspects,is that because there 
is no
&gt; real danger?i have read and done shielding visualizations i found 
on
&gt; various site but that really doesn't seem to do anything.this isn't
&gt; continous just ocassionaly.is this something to worry about or 
should
&gt; i just ignore negative entities?
