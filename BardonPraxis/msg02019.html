<pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>Dear David,</pre><br>
<tt>That is soo cool. Its really really cool cause this confirms what I have 
been getting too. The subconscious area/zone where lucid dreaming and stuff 
takes place is a very very powerful tool for self observation and change.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Here is what I have done :<br>
I was performing the step 2 auto-suggestion step and I was working over a 
few weeks on a few different problems. I woould repeat the phrase like : I 
am a disciplined person. Then as I fell asleep, I would dream. In that 
dreams itself, my subconscious presented a variety of scenarios as to how my 
changed lifestyle would be. IT showed me being more disciplined, more humble 
and stuff like that. When I woke up, I would be convinced of this fact and 
really change my life to this new style.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Of course after a whle of slacking, I would lose touch of this and revert 
back to my lazy state. But for that period of time, nothing else mattered 
because my statement of will was true. Cool huh?</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I saw this happening with sexual things as well. I would like be thinking of 
this girl or thinking of sex before sleep(can't blame a guy can ya?) and 
when i fell off to sleep, I would 100% dream of something sexual that gave 
me all the sexual provocativeness i needed for the next day. And cool enough 
this changed my charisma because from being a rather unattractive shy guy, I 
would notice girls checking me out and for the first time when i looked into 
their eyes, they didn't like turn away or stuff but we could keep on looking 
for a while and stuff like that....wicked :)</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Think about it man...we've got an awesome tool for self-observation and 
change. ANYTHING is possible. To test this, I am very very homophobic, so I 
experimented with whether i could change this. I'll be damned that very 
night i dreamt i was ahem...doing something funky with a guy. The next day, 
I wasn't repulsed anymore but thank god, neither was I attracted. Now I am 
not homophobic but more accepting. But sadly, thjere are somethings that I 
know are wrong in my life but I just don't WANT to change it...</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Keep on experimenting buddy/ies :) Magic is not too different from science, 
except we're way ahead of em :)))</tt><br>
<br>

Subject: [BardonPraxis] Interesting experience to share
Date: Sat, 27 Dec 2003 19:27:03 -0000</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi, I just thought I'd share this experience I had this morning.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">To preface: I've been really working on emptiness or vacancy of mind,
and also thought discipline in everyday life. I've been finding it
pretty difficult.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Lately, to add to that, I've been eating a lot of sugar, and just
sitting around, which I think contributed to my mental agitation and
restlessness. It has made for difficult meditation -- it's hard to
even pay attention to how my mind likes to be distracted.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I woke up at 4:30 to go to the bathroom and my mind was so jerky that
I couldn't get back to sleep until around 6. When I finally did
drift back to sleep, at some point I found myself in a lucid dream.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I've had lucid dreams before, but at the point in my life when I was
really trying for them -- when I really put a lot of myself into the
effort -- they tended to be very short and also very sexual, in a
knee-jerk way.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">This was pretty different. The dream-situation was fairly normal --
just walking around in a public area. But this time I was relaxing
into it, which I usually forget to do. For the first time I had a
sense that I could keep myself from waking up, by relaxing. I
attribute this to the practice of meditation, making me more aware of
how I tense up and am afraid all of the time.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Well, I was walking around, and I had a few different kinds of
experiences.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Every time I saw a woman that I was sexually attracted to, and
started thinking, hey maybe I'll try to have sex with her, she
started to fade and the dream went all hazy, as it does just before I
wake up. So I tried to relax away from that desire. Then it
happened a few more times, and I realized what was happening: my
desire was causing tension in me.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">A little bit later, I was walking down a road and somehow I had a
garland of flowers around my head. Then suddenly it was a vine of
some evil plant that started biting me. I tried to get away from it,
but the more I resisted, the more surrounded I was by trees and vines
that were biting and snapping at me. Again, I realized what was
happening, and I stopped resisting. I let them bite me. It hurt for
a few more moments, and then they all vanished.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I realized then that any kind of ATTACHMENT caused me to tense and
grasp the object of attachment, or push away from it, depending on
the nature of the attachment. And that caused the reality of the
dream to fade. Conversely, when I was NOT attached, I couldn't
believe the clarity of the dream. I could see details of leaves on
trees a hundred yards away. So this has definite analogues to
physical vision, too. Everything become so real and vivid -- until I
got attached to something else, which was pretty frequently.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I thought that this experience really strongly illustrated the effect
of attachment on consciousness. I've heard and read Tibetan
Buddhists saying that the lucid dream state is the fast track to
enlightenment, and I can see why. The effects of attachment were so
immediate; it's necessary to cultivate a deep presence and attitude
of nonattachment in order to even stay in the dream. And, there are
so many opportunities for immediate gratification.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">In addition to having &quot;enlightenment&quot; possibilities, experiences like
this seem to give really good feedback for what needs to be worked on
in terms of soul mirror stuff.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">So, just thought I'd share. I don't have many lucid dreams anymore
but I guess that one was brought on by insomnia. Maybe I should do
that more often. :)</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>Thanks,
David</pre><br>
