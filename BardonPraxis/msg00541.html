<pre>NB,

I'd like to put forth an antecdotal story about my Taiji Quan 
instructor that is quite relevent to the current situation.

My Taiji Quan instructor got into Taiji Quan and Qigong because he 
snapped both of his achilles tendons and subsequently went into rehab 
and had an operation on his achilles tendons that left quite a bit of 
scar tissue on his heels. Among his rehabilitation he took up the art 
of Taiji Quan and Qigong, both practices which involve the 
cultivation and circulation of Qi, roughly the equivelent of Vital 
Energy in IIH. After a number of years of practice he re-experienced 
the same pain he felt when he broke his achilles heels and 
experienced a great amount of fear that he had re-injured his tendons 
again. He told this to his instructor at the time, Dr. Shen Zaiwen I 
believe, who told him to keep on practicing his Qigong routines on a 
regular basis. After a couple of months of training afterwards his 
scar tissue fell away and his achilles tendons are pretty much as 
good as before they where first injured.

Physiologically speaking, energy moves easier through relaxed muscle 
tissue. Scar tissue as a whole represents a clump of tightened, 
fuzed, muscle tissue that is anything but relaxed. Basically 
speaking, when you start to circulate this energy it slowly works 
away at any blockages that it comes into contact with.

Having personally experienced something to this effect on a much 
lesser scale, I would just suggest, in addition to what Rawn 
suggests, is to keep on practicing your meditations on a more or less 
consistent basis as you can handle.

Live well,
Peter Reist

&gt; I have a few deep scars on both sides of my chest, resulting of 
&gt; several chirurgical operations I had to go through a few years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; I noted several times that those scars got quite painful *during* 
my 
&gt; meditations (regardless of their type : one pointedness, VOM, 
&gt; archaeous, or any other kind), along with the usual feeling of the 
&gt; skin getting electrical etc.; the scars stay painful quite a long 
&gt; time after the end of the exercise. The fact that I'm sitting on a 
&gt; armchair, or that I'm in my bed etc. does not make any difference.
&gt; 
&gt; It's as if those scars were &quot;switched on&quot; by this &quot;electrical 
skin&quot;, 
&gt; which (if I clearly understand) may be a feedback mimicked by the 
&gt; astral body. 
&gt; My deduction was that since the astral body was in charge of the 
&gt; sensations, it would be normal for it to convey more information 
&gt; (here a pain) when given the focus and more energy. 
&gt; 
&gt; Like this weird sensation of magnetic field when I concentrate, 
this 
&gt; did not happen even two weeks ago : maybe a consequence of my 
&gt; concentration getting better :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I'll start healing the wounds using the magic of water (&quot;as below, 
&gt; so above etc.&quot;) but I would be thankful if somebody could give me a 
&gt; hint also. 
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks.
&gt; NB
