<pre>Dear Rawn,

This does clear up some things, yet in the process there's another 
two questions for each previous question that was answered.

When I talked about colour taking precedence within Bardon's KTQ, I 
meant to say is that working with colour is the first step within KTQ 
where one bonds the colour to the letter. In essence, it doesn't 
appear as if one is working towards an understanding of the essential 
meaning of the letter and then finding a colour that appropriatly 
expresses that essential meaning. Rather it seems that you're getting 
a pre-prackaged set of colours that express essential meaning in a 
certian manner that Bardon has found works for himself. The questions 
that arise from this are: Why is this apparent difference in 
methodology apparent? and, more importently How would suggest that I 
go about finding out what the essentially meaning of any specific 
letter, path or sepheroth?

In order to find out the essential meaning of the various sepheroth I 
have been meditating rather extensivly upon the pattern on the 
trestleboard by Paul Foster Case, and have managed to produce quite a 
number of pages as to my thoughts and ideas as to what all these 
statements mean, singularly or in conjunction with each other. 
Moreover, these insights come soley from working with the pattern of 
the trestleboard with little formal studying of the tree of life 
previously.

Most of these insights coming to me while working within a state of 
one pointedness or vacancy of mind. During which I have experienced a 
number of different shifts in consciousness, as well as several very 
prevently feelings and images associated with each of the statements. 
The most prevelent of which at the moment seems to be that of 
4, &quot;From the exhaustless riches of it's infinite substance, I draw 
all things needfull, both spiritual and material&quot; is like soaring 
over an great forest, the great blue sky streatching out for what 
seems like forever. Though it does not quite represent an airy sort 
of energy, but rather something that is firmly rooted within the 
realm of earth and all of the four elements. The exhuastless riches 
that Paul Foster Case speaks of in this statement does not appear to 
be gold and silver, due to the fact that these are not needs, but 
rather wants. These needs are food, shelter, warmth, love and 
spirituality. This all seems to be a certian sort of feeling that is 
expressed in the form of that imagry and energy.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
