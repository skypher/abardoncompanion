<pre>Hello Mark:

I would like to make a correction in my reply. I wrote the following: 
&quot;
We could see the vertical line as 
being the involutional process or the level of mechanical function or the 
habitual level of human consciousness.&quot; 

This should read, &quot;We could see the HORIZONTAL line as being the involutional 
process or the level of mechanical function or the habitual level of human 
consciousness.&quot;

Hope that didn't confuse you.

Robert

Hello Mark:

You wrote, &quot;I am aware that this arguement can be used as the perfect cop-out 
for 
anything, but I think it's also a necessary realisation for ascendence.&quot;

I think the Christain cross is a good symbol, in which the answer to your 
question about free will may be found amd this realisation for ascendence. 
There are two lines to the cross, one horizontal and the other vertical, as you 
probably know. We could see the vertical line as being the involutional process 
or the level of mechanical function or the habitual level of human 
consciousness.

This is actually a state of unconsciousness, where there is no choice or free 
will. Individuals function based upon the well known stimulus-response 
mechanism. We might think we have a choice and free will, but our emotional 
reaction to an environmental stimulus is on the horizontal level. If one 
continues on this level, s/he eventually goes down and out. Energy is 
dissipated at this level and one has no choice at that level. The attitude &quot;why 
me, Lord&quot; becomes another habitual expression and based upon one's lack of 
understanding of the law of Cause and Effect. We are much more familar with the 
horizontal level than the vertical ascendent.

The vertical ascendent line is the place of choice and free will, because here 
there is consciousness at a higher level of being. When one starts out on the 
vertical ascendent, there is a much different experience as a result of that. 
Things of a higher nature and quality comes down the vertical line and 
materalizes on the physical level, the horizontal line. One begins to act in a 
conscious manner to external stimuli and one's expression is appropriate to the 
situation. It is not a mechanical reaction.

I think one of the most difficult things to overcome is our habitual emotional 
responses to 
whatever captures our attention in any given moment. We can become lost in the 
movie we are watching or the book we are reading or the person we are 
identifying with. When we do this, immediately in a flash, we are on the 
horizontal descendent line.

I think the Bardon system, through the steps, inspires one to step off the 
horizontal line, the path of least resistance, onto the vertical line of 
ascension, which really requires a great deal of effort. This alone deters 
those curiosity seekers who do not want to make any personal effort to improve 
themselves, but just want things handed to them on a silver platter.

Even as far back as early Christian days, the question was asked, &quot;Who shall 
ASCEND into the hill of the Lord?&quot; Who is willing to step off the horizontal 
path onto the vertical ascendent? That's the big question?

Thank you Mark for using the word &quot;ascendence&quot;. It really opened things up for 
me. A lot of personal questions arose in me.

Hi All,

(note: I think this is relevant here and not on Magi Rawn, if not - junk it, 
but I'd be grateful for anyones thoughts on the point though! Incidentally, 
everything went a notch up and everything has turned out fine, thanks for your 
previous help!)

I have a query regarding free will. Rawn mentioned a while ago that by living 
in the temporal now is the only way you can maintain free will (after you reach 
a certain level of integration with the higher self and the all). I have long 
been under the impression that there is no free will at any point as every 
action undertaken is a perfect representation of every circumstance that has 
lead to the present level of consciousness, thus any action / reaction that 
occurs in the physical is, by definition, the only action that could have taken 
place; any other response / action / whatever is physically impossible to 
happen. So the question is, to what extent is there genuine free will, as I am 
under the distinct impression that the illusion of free will in workers is the 
main driving force behind life and QED the magics. Also, does the extent of 
potential free will differ depending on the level of an initate?

I am aware that this arguement can be used as the perfect cop-out for anything, 
but I think it's also a necessary realisation for ascendence.

Incidentally, on the &quot;Starving Somalian&quot; thing from Jeremy, nobody mentioned 
that Universal law states that a starving 6 year old in Somalia is meant to be 
starving in Somalia; Hermetics or no - everything is as it is meant to be.

Communion to all,

Mark
