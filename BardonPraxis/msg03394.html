&gt; No. Just *observe*. This is different than &quot;following&quot; a train of
&gt; thoughts. Just observe, without *any* involvement, whatever transpires,
&gt; even if by detaching from participation in its workings, your mind
&gt; happens to quiet itself. Just *observe* :)
&gt; 


Very curious i'm having more trouble grasping this then i would of
thought...

I find that if i &quot;observe&quot; a thought my will poors into that thought
train impowering it,giving it its own gravity..

am i to assume that the underlining will/energy as long as it is
formless can flow into the thoughttrain as long as the observing
&quot;self&quot; doesn't connect directly to that thoughttrain or ride
it?Because if i cease all will it ceeases the thoughts/movements of
the conciousness,its like sitting in a puddle of dark water(the
unconciouss)to which the will/energy flows from if you know what i
mean?i might be aware of this prematurly(at least sooner then bardon
assumes which is why he doesn't mention this) since I used to go into
trances (physical paralysis acompanied with a 'door&quot; opening up and
moving inward to the unconciouss,have you ever experienced anything
like this??)

from what i take it the point is to retain the &quot;Ego&quot; or Sense of self
in its bubble and just observe the exterior sphere of random thoughts
emerging from the unconciouss?as long as no thought-webs form and
attach that ego with the thought-patterns in that exterior
thought-sphere?If I do this i feel some sense of alignment with the
unconciouss will like i'm being fed/revitalized,i assume this is a
good sign??


the second excercise

If i am correct you are saying that the point is meerly to focus on
the &quot;seed&quot; of thought in the unconcioussness(Gnosis/blackball) and not
let ones awareness flow to the layer of images/movements/material
expressions and associations?but its okay to have that sphere of
expressions to be in ones concioussness?like if i focus on the thought
of a watermelon I just have to focus on the underlinining impulse or
&quot;thought&quot; of the watermelon and just not let the arising
aossciations(sight,smell,waste,weight,texture) draw ones will away
from the underlining formless seedthought of the watermelon?

3rd &quot;going with fear&quot; at times these negative images seem to be coming
at me but i resist them because of their ugliness,sometimes though
these things fly into me as soon as i see them so i don't have time to 
put up my defenses and oddly anuff i feel as if they dissolve into
me,vitalizing me somewhat(not a negative experience) and othertimes
they even produce a physical effect of being jolted if you know what i
mean?like a minor kundalini movement.


If i ascertain you advice correctly then

1 i should be observing the dynamic with my mind without leting direct 
channels form between the ego(ball of action) and the exterior sphere
of thoughts/potentialities

2 focus on a thought-seed but don't try and supress the arising
associations like i'v been doining?

and 3 simple purify ones conciouss of all but the ego of
awareness?hacking down thoughts before they cross the boarder from
the formless unconciouss to this material-thought-sphere(if you know
what i mean)


if i can symbolize it like this

unconciouss will -&gt;
conciouss ego is 0
thought patterns before conciouss and after ~
the boarder is | between unconciouss and ego
excercise one is -&gt;|0 ~
excercise two is -&gt;~|0
ecercise three is -&gt;|0 -~ 

dunno if that is comprehensiable much less helpfull....
