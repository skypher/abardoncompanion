<pre>Dear Jen,

Glad to hear you are feeling better. I usually don't like to give advice, 
since every body (no pun) is different and reacts differently. However, the 
old European way of breaking a fever is NOT the wet cloth on your forehead, 
but around your lower legs and feet. Sometimes the feet were placed into a 
bucket of cold water. One of the many dangers of HIGH fever is brain damage. 
By putting the cold cloth onto your forehead, your are cooling down this 
area, and thereby literally drawing the HEAT UP into your head.
The European method seems to actually correspond to the tetrapolar make-up of 
the human body. You draw the heat away from your body and down into the 
earth. Just picture your roots going into the earth, as described in the 
*Self Healing Archaeous*. You can draw up nourishment from the earth, 
through your body's earth region, but you also can drain negativity or 
illness out of your body and into the earth.

Again, this was used for HIGH, dangerous fevers only. Fever in itself is a 
very healthy body reaction to kill off the bad guys, so to speak, but there 
is a fine line.

One medication I found very effective against the flu, and is has to be taken 
at the FIRST symptoms, is &quot;oscillococcinum&quot;. I usually have it in the house, 
just in case... It is a homeopathic remedy and can be obtained from Boiron. 
www.oscillo.com or by calling 1-800-672-4556. I don't have any stocks in 
that company &lt;BG&gt;.
But since Franz Bardon was a Naturopath and homeopathy acts by 
activating/stimulating your own body's healing, I feel it fits into the 
course of hermetic studies.

Hope to have been helpful!
With my best wishes for health,
Alexandra

&lt;&lt; Now that my fever has broken I can be a little clearer - I had used a cold
wet cloth on my forhead for the fever and I guess it is best not to get out
of balance in the first place. If anyone can add to these things of what you
have found to work for flu, either in treatment or in prevention then I am
interested to know.
Thanks
Jen &gt;&gt;
