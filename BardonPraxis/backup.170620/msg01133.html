<pre>I know I am going to make you sick with this, but I'm on the 
opposite end. I swear its genetic ;)

Anyway, if would like some approaches on how to beat your problem, I 
can help, just send me an email. But I don't really see not doing 
well that math as a part of the personality, unless there is 
something deeper at the root. I had a similar type of problem (not 
being able to do something that I tried hard at) and found that the 
object that I was trying to overcome, was not the obstacle. I was 
something related, but yet not even close (vague I know...).

I'd suggest looking at math from a different perspective, as in 
through meditation. Think about the problem. Why can't you 
succeed? Is there something you missed? What's the biggest problem?

It could be that its the approach you take to it, or a negative mind 
set so that you are sabotaging yourself before you even start. 
Giving you no way to succeed.

Just some thoughts.

&gt; Ok, i have a question n the negative soul mirror as well, 
unfortunately i cant think of a way to ask without naming the fault 
so ...sorry??!!
&gt; 
&gt; I am buggerd when it comes to math, in grade school and high 
school i would always fail or pull out of it with a d+. I tried in 
college to succed in math (003!!!!) and i couldn't even then. I have 
had numerous tutors and tried as hard as i knew how, all for naught.
&gt; 
&gt; So i come to IIH and listing of negative traits, well i sucked at 
math so guess what was on there?? You guessed it folks Mathmatics! 
So i come to my question : If i have tried for most of my walking 
life to understand this and conquer my problem with the language of 
the universe how can i POSSIBLY win now! I am left with these 
options; either scratch off math and call it a day. Or i can once 
again try my best to make my eyes pop out and head burst by TRYING 
to learn Math.Or finally: Give up my quest for divine re-union all 
because my left brain is not up to par. :( &lt;o (teardrop)
&gt; 
&gt; If there is to be no success had, what to do????
&gt; Please be gentle with the answer folks :)
