<pre>Dear NKKA,
I enjoyed reading your post. Before addressing your statements and 
questions I must let you know that my perspective will be based on an 
anthropological perspective and not Hermetic. I have two undergraduate degrees, 
one is in 
anthropology the other psychology. If I correctly understand your comments, 
you are concerned about what an individual would consider to be positive as 
opposed to a negetive characteristic. You also mentioned culture. 
&gt;From the above mentioned perspective (anthropological), we must look at the 
cultural norms as well as the mythos/belief system of the culture and the 
individuals role in that culture. For example; there are some cultures that 
allow their children, around the age of 12 to 13, to go out into the 
woods/jungle and have sexual relations. It is not necessary to have parental 
conscent. 
This is an acceptable practice within that culture. If the individuals 
were to come to the US and the parents of these children allowed the same 
behavior in our culture they would soon have to deal with child protective 
services.
The same is true from a historical perspective. At one time people of a 
certain faith sacrificed animals to God. This is no longer accepted. In other 
words when society views your actions/passions and they do not fit within 
social norms, regardless of your belief system, you will be viewed on laws that 
are written based on the social norms of that society. &quot;When in Rome do as 
the Romans.&quot;
You also mentioned killing, either in war or for some government agency. 
This is the sticky part. In war society would view this as normal behavioir 
and perhaps so would a government agency (though they probably would never 
admit it). However, people of various belief systems within our society would 
hold views that are in opposition to one another.
The real question is this. How does it feel to you to exhibit a certain 
passion or behavior? Does it really feel correct and comfortable? If it does 
and it fits within the laws and acceptable norms of the society in which you 
live then you possibly can consider it a positive behavior.
&gt;From a clinical socialwork perspective ( which I have a masters degree, for 
what it's worth) I would ask; How does this behavior/passion affect your 
life and/or the lives of others around you? Is it in a positive or negative 
way? 
You may find this method an acceptable way to evaluate your issue.
Finally, on the issue of noble. I personally consider noble to be above the 
norm. Such as nobility are supposed to be above the average person. 
Regarding your soul mirror, I must admit that I am new to the Bardon system, 
but 
not new to the study of behavior. I didn't want to toot my horn regarding 
degrees I have attained, its just that I wanted you to know that my 
perspectives 
are acceptable ones, at least within the fields that I listed. I hope I have 
been of some help. I won't bill you.
Best regards'
Dan
