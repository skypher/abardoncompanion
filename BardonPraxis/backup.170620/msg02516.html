<pre>Thank you for your insight, it is greatly appreciated. I have much
thinking to do, and will hopefully end up making what is the right
decision for me personaly.

&gt; Dear 'golden558dragon',
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; What about his views concerning a temporary abstinence from sex and
&gt; the one week of fasting. Would there be any advantages in starting your
&gt; magical practise in such a manor, seeing as it might destroy laevas and
&gt; train your will ??? &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; In my &quot;Commentary Upon IIH: Step One&quot; I suggested the temporary
&gt; cessation of all caffeine, nicotine, cannabis, alcohol and of anything
&gt; else that alters the brain's chemistry, so that the mind is clear for
&gt; the mental exercises. The mind must be mastered when it is functioning
&gt; normally instead of when it is being influenced and therefore
&gt; functioning abnormally.
&gt; 
&gt; Periodic fasting is always a good idea since, when done properly, it
&gt; purifies the body of toxins and brings the bodies digestive system back
&gt; into proper balance. But even better than periodic fasting is the
&gt; consistent eating of a healthy diet.
&gt; 
&gt; In the absence of sexual addiction, a temporary abstinence from sex
&gt; will indeed increase your overall energy, leaving you with more energy
&gt; for concentration if that is otherwise a problem for you. [However, I
&gt; must point out that the only sexual alternative Blystone offers to
&gt; permanent abstinence is involvement in a monogamous, committed
&gt; (heterosexual) relationship. According to him, if you are not in such a
&gt; relationship then abstinence is your only option (he declares
&gt; casual sex and masturbation as unacceptable).]
&gt; 
&gt; And of course, practicing *any* asceticism will strengthen your will.
&gt; 
&gt; But so far as these practices themselves eliminating larvae, this is not
&gt; guaranteed. For example, if sexual addiction or food addiction or
&gt; substance addiction are issues you face, then a temporary cessation of
&gt; all things having to do with the object of your addiction *without
&gt; simultaneously and directly addressing the root addiction issues* will
&gt; often have the opposite affect of increasing the strength of attendant
&gt; larvae and draining *you* of energy. So if you do practice these
&gt; asceticisms he suggests then I recommend that you also be ready to deal
&gt; with all of the addiction issues that arise.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; On his yoga regime, what do you think would be the benefits of
&gt; following his regime to the letter and would there be any unforeseen
&gt; dangers in doing so ??? &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; The benefits and dangers, *if you follow his instructions to the letter*
&gt; (which includes an exhaustive study of the Yogic literature in addition
&gt; to following his given instructions) would obviously be the benefits and
&gt; dangers espoused in the Yogic literature. :) However, I must point out
&gt; that Yoga is not *Hermetics* -- it is not *part of* the *Hermetic* path
&gt; of initiation. It can indeed make a good *addition to* but it is not a
&gt; *part of* it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Also would there be some advantages in waiting with some of his
&gt; lessons, and then using them as a compliment to some of the more
&gt; advances IIH lessons ??? &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Yes and I think his sensory exercise is a case in point. It could be
&gt; used effectively in conjunction with the work of being able to identify
&gt; the separate organs and regions of the body.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Finally what about his comments on some of the books of the Bible and
&gt; his comments on the Tarot, something I personally found to be some of
&gt; the most interesting parts of the book. Do you agree with his ideas, and
&gt; if not then why ??? &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; I glossed over most of this material since it didn't interest me.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way, to a point I also agree with you about his writing style.
&gt; It is sometimes slow, a bit to melodramatic, and clearly painted by his
&gt; Gnostic beliefs, but at the same time I also think he wrote it like that
&gt; to convey a point (be careful not to accept everything, do not think the
&gt; occult sciences is a game, etc.). &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, obviously it was done intentionally and after just a couple of
&gt; chapters the reader should have more than gotten his point that
&gt; initiation is serious business and that one should think for themselves.
&gt; :) But after a while it got tiresome and seemed to have to do with more
&gt; than just making a point.
&gt; 
&gt; One final comment on &quot;Paenitere&quot;. When I add up all the daily time
&gt; commitments and life changes that Blystone demands as absolute
&gt; requirements of the &quot;neophyte&quot;, I see an erection of barriers instead of
&gt; the breaking down of them. It is clear to my mind that Bardon wrote IIH
&gt; in order to make Hermetic initiation *more* accessible to *more* people.
&gt; In many places in his books he emphasized the fact that initiation was
&gt; possible for the &quot;ordinary man&quot; who lives an ordinary life. It's not
&gt; reserved just for those who can spend at least six hours a day devoted
&gt; exclusively to exercises and the study of books. That's all wonderful
&gt; when it can be managed and can make for very quick progress, but it is
&gt; not *necessary*. And in this day and age it is not even *possible* for
&gt; the vast majority of those interested in pursuing their initiation. In
&gt; point of fact, the vast majority of the students that I know of are
&gt; making excellent progress devoting only a couple of hours each day, some
&gt; on even less! It *might* take &quot;longer&quot; if one devotes fewer hours per
&gt; day but this is *not* a race -- in fact, trying to race is very
&gt; counter-productive.
&gt; 
&gt; In effect, Mr. Blystone sets out a path of initiation that *uses* IIH as
&gt; its foundation but which *diverges from* Bardon's course. It's sort of
&gt; a &quot;Bardon Plus&quot;. ;-) Personally, I don't see that &quot;Plus&quot; as being in
&gt; the Bardonian spirit of making initiation *more* accessible. Instead,
&gt; it seems to take us back a century or two.
&gt; 
&gt; But that is only *my* opinion as an admitted &quot;Bardon purist&quot;. ;-) I
&gt; encourage you to do as Mr. Blystone repeatedly suggests and form your
&gt; *own* opinion. :) It is after all, *your* initiation and you get to do
&gt; whatever *you* want to do.
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you as always,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
