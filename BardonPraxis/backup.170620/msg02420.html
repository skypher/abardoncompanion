<pre style="margin: 0em;">Dear Johan,</pre><br>
<tt>Thanks for bringing up[ an interesting thread. I have enjoyed reading 
the dialogue. I thought I would add a couple things from my own 
perspective as a 'full time' 'healing practitioner'.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>First of all, I don't think that healers can actually heal anyone. If 
we define 'healing' according to it's root meaning 'to become more 
whole', then how could we be so arrogant as to think we can make 
someone else whole? People ultimately must heal themselves, and 
resolving their issues and splits is between them and their Maker. 
This is something each of us must do for ourselves and no healer can 
do this for us, no matter how much we pay. So I don't think you can 
charge money for true healing, nor can we really 'heal' a person 
even if they do pay us. Holding to the misconception that we are 
'healers' leads to real difficulties in the long run.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>So if we are incapable of healing people, how can we charge for it? 
True healing is not a product or commodity, it is not something you go 
out and buy. If we hold ourselves out to the community as if we really 
do heal people, I believe we are doing everyone a disservice, 
especially if we charge for it. For example, your 'patients' will 
become dependent on you, and often disappointed because you can't 
deliver on your promise. You will get burned out eventually with this 
path and with your lack of success.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>So what can we do? My experience indicates that we can 'assist' people 
in their own healing work, that we can shine light on the path that 
they must travel in order to heal, and that we can use the healing 
arts to palliate certain affections 'as a means to an end' ; but it 
is an end that that they must find for themselves. By serving in this 
way, we are part of their karma instead of attempting to rise above it.</tt><br>
<br>
<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><tt>From this standpoint, we can offer a service, but not a product. It 
</tt></blockquote><tt>is a service that carries no guarantee or promised result. Can we 
charge money for this? I think we should re- frame the question 'Do 
we Need to charge for our services'? If so, then we should charge 
exactly what we 'need' to charge, as long as we are truly being honest 
with ourselves about what we 'need'. For example, I am someone who 
felt 'called' into the healing profession at an early age. When I 
examine my life, I conclude that I currently 'need' to charge 
for at least some of my time and services, especially because I 
need to distribute money in my role as a 'householder'. However, I 
perform my services in exactly the same fashion at times when I don't 
'need' to charge. I also see that, as my life goes on and I 
develop, my needs change so this whole money equation may change for 
the better. In the meantime, I enjoy the chances I have to serve' free 
of charge'.</tt><br>
<br>

<pre style="margin: 0em;"><br></pre><br>
<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><tt>Not many people would be able to see what the patients karma is.<br>
And not all disease is due to karma. So what right do I have to go<br>
around starting to guess about what is caused by karma, and what not.<br>
I take it that you meant that Pranic Healing does not conform to<br>
Universal Legality? I do not agree. The healer cannot interfere with<br>
the patients karma. No amount of healing I do will cure a patient if<br>
his illness is due to his karma that has not been worked out.Worrying<br>
about incurring karmic debt in this case would be like worrying about<br>
incurring karmic debt every time one steps on an ant by accident:)<br>
And as a healer one discusses these issues with a patient. I talk to<br>
the patient and try to determine the cause of the illness. It is 
discussed<br>
that if certain changes are not made then the illness might recur. I 
teach<br>
them<br>
about introspection and meditation etc. It is up to the patient to then<br>
change<br>
and learn. I must add that if I know what the problem is, and I know 
that<br>
the<br>
patient is unwilling to learn and change, then I would consider 
withholding<br>
treatment. I have recently had a case like that with family.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>What I meant was that if someone pays me to heal them, and I take the 
money,<br>
then I have to do the healing. If they do not have the money and they 
should<br>
ask for healing, then I have the choice to heal or not. It is 
important that<br>
the patient not be burdened financially. I have no problem to heal for 
free<br>
all the time. I put the same effort in every healing session I do. My 
point<br>
is that<br>
if I do not ask money, then the bank will repossess my car, I could 
not buy<br>
fuel to go heal,<br>
and my son and I would die of hunger:)<br>
I did not seek support for my view, or care if anyone wants to pass<br>
judgment:)<br>
I just stated a point of view:)</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I just wanted to repeat that I was in no way implying that TMO WG has
anything but the
best and most noble intensions.</pre><br>
<tt>My post are not meant to criticize or insult. These are my views now. 
They<br>
may or may not change in the future:)<br>
I do hope that those reading our posts will ponder these issues for<br>
themselves.<br>
Especially those in modern medicine:)</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I thank you for your kindness and great replies Rawn.
You always make me think:)
