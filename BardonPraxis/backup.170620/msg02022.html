<pre>I completely agree that people interpret dreams in accordance with 
their ego. Untill the ego is not deluding the psyche anymore, I 
believe one should utilize as many methods as possible to find out 
what it means. I am on a farely meager budget and cannot afford a 
therapist. I learned this method from a friend a few years ago that 
was seeing a psychiatrist. He told me the method the Dr. told him 
and it has been useful for me. I hope that it can come to use here 
for others.

I. Write the dream/s first thing in the morning when they are the 
most clear. Almost as if the dream is being dreamed again; reliving 
it actually. Now, after the dream/s is/are written down in full, ask 
yourself the following questions. Go through the dream/s from 
beginning to end with each question, repeatedly asking yourself the 
questions untill you get no more answers for each set.

1. What body sensations do I feel at this time as I reflect on this 
part of the dream? (this is to be asked for all parts of the dream. 
for each individual part it is to be asked until no more answers come 
to mind).

2. What emotions am I aware of (come to mind) at this time as I 
reflect... (same as above)

3. What thoughts am I aware of.....

4. What does this dream remind me of in life...

6. What judgements, interpretations, conclusions come to mind

Using this method (according to my understanding; if its flawed 
please let me know or expand the thought if you have any ideas), you 
get at the physical, astral and mental areas. This way you can get 
at the root of what the dream means so you can understand what is 
going on so as to change something if it is necessary.

(just had a thought about incorporating this method into my soul 
mirror. Hmm)

&gt; No argument, here, but a caution: Sometimes dreams are pretty 
straightforward, and then there is no problem. But dreams can 
mislead as well as enlighten. I have observed on a few occasions a 
person interpreting one of his or her dreams in a narcisisstic or ego-
inflating direction, but FAR MORE OFTEN, when left on our own, we 
tend to interpret dreams unfairly to our own detriment. That is, we 
are often way too harsh with ourselves. If you plan to employ 
dreamwork as an important part of your journey toward self-
understanding, may I recommend that you find a trusted and competent 
friend (or even a professional, preferably a Jungian therapist) to 
help you maintain a sense of balance, and to preserve an attitude of 
mercy and kindness toward yourself.

&gt; The problem i've found though is in maintaining the awarenesses 
gained in dreams. I find that being physical carries all sorts of 
distractions that being in a dream doesn't. In dreams, the dream 
reality is the mirror.
