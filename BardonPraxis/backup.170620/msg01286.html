<pre>Good afternoon, all;

I am deep into Step IV of IIH, Lesson 7 of TMO IHVH-ADNI, Lesson Five
of the Self Healing Archaeous, and I fiddled with Step one of the KTQ,
baby blue letter A/Note G, Air/Intelligence. And I use the Center of
Stillness Meditation.

I know that generally it is ok, once one feels and knows it is stable,
to stack exercises together. But I am a beginner in these exercises
and want to know if this stacking method that I've used today has been
done by anyone else, seems stable and will be likely to produce
stable, good results or if there are cracks in the logic will will
probably lead me astray. 

I Meditated on the Center of Stillness Meditation, while still within
it, I stacked about 3 affirmation positive thoughts with TMO
IHVH-ADNI, then I breathed in one breath of each element into its
place in my body in each of the three bodies, physical, astral,
mental. And then in that space I stepped out of myself in my mental
body and then in my astral body I stepped out about three times. I
knew that the astral separation was going on because each time I
willed to separate with that body, I felt my legs become tingle and
then become numb, like they were sleeping deeply. I only stood beside
myself each time. I heard the door open downstairs three times and
knew that someone had come home, my inlaws. My wife was sitting at the
computer playing a game while I was meditating. Bobby, our white cat
interrupted me with jumping up on my legs and digging his head into
the palm of my hand to be petted. Grins.

I layed my astral body down slowly and then my astral and then
established recontact and &quot;fit&quot; with my physical body within about 15
seconds and it was pretty smooth. My wife said I was asleep. Mouth
open and snoring. Funny I didn't notice any snoring at all. Though of
course I received the deep benefit and joy of the deep body relaxation
of the physical body in this state. When I sleep for an hour or so in
the afternoon I wake up droggy headed and it takes about an hour, hour
and 1/2 to come back from the dregs to clear reality, but in this
state I was awake and pert and alert and wide awake. So by that I know
that it was meditating and not sleep. Plus so much went on in that
mere 1 1/2 hour of meditation. Good, good stuff.

The only thing I noticed about an hour later, out front on the steps
having a cigarette, is that I had forgotten to breath back &quot;out&quot; the
one breath of each element into the three bodies. Which I then did
immediately and relaxedly. There were no overabundance of element
feelings from this. In a way it is a high to absorb even one extra
breath of each element in each of the three bodies. I have to over
come that sense of addiction and just enjoy the usage of the extra
functionality. 

I &quot;did&quot; remember to and accomplished re&quot;claiming&quot; my senses that were
placed by me in the spheres around myself in the CSM meditation step,
after the cat awoke me. 

My point of all of this is that the separation from the physical body
of the astral/mental body was so simple and effortless while within
CSM meditation than when I do it just as an exercise in itself. I
guess one must only differentiate between being in a meditative
productive state of being and not just a trance where one may not
recall what is occurring.???

By the way, I &quot;will&quot; not be attempting the KTQ Caballistic attempts at
using the letters until I am advanced to the degree required to
navigate that realm easily. Yes, I did wake up the next morning after
meditating in the three bodies and the three voice (physical, mental,
astral) on the letter A in note G and in the easily atainable baby
blue (light blue) color, and I had a long before awakening state where
I was &quot;organizing&quot; easily three level sub groups of &quot;something&quot; ( I do
not know what) and it interested me because being sequential and
orderly is not my forte', and throughout the day I found it easy to
sequentially do things, which stood out to me also. Yes, I had those
results from one mere practice. 

BUT, I also felt disorientated and unbalanced in the slightest bit,
perhaps because I knew that this was only one charge of one letter and
that I needed all of the letters sequentially to receive the entire
balanced package of stretching to my next level. AND I know that I am
just beginning in stretching myself with the elements, so any results
would be minimum compared to the full degree charge I would receive
when fully stretched to handle it all. 

So, I will now progress on the practices I am absorbing and continue
on. It is a good thing for some at times to actually put our hand on
the hot burner, even though we've been told. Grins. For me anyway, it
is good to stretch myself beyond my bounds and easily retreat back to
safety, knowing some of the territory ahead which may be helpful to my
walk on my path. For instance, by this I know that I am going to begin
painting in predominately light blues, while listening to classical
music in the key of G and thinking on &quot;mindful, intelligent&quot; thoughts,
and the same with each other letter and tone/note during this next
year, to &quot;familiarize&quot; myself with the college level prospectus that
is to come with KTQ. In that way I will have done some of the
memorizing and preliminary work in a simple way which is enjoyable and
easy for me. Shrugs. :)

Any thoughts, appreaicate.
As always I Wish You Well,
Chuck
