<pre>In thinking of ways to link between my practices of Self-Healing Archaeous 
and IIH, I thought about the room impregnation of Step 3. Could this be used 
to alert you to someone coming to interrupt you? For instance, if I 
impregnate the room with the idea that I be alerted if anyone was coming in, 
could that help to lessen the danger of someone coming in while performing 
the work of Lesson 4 of SHA? Even with a locked door, an unplugged 
phone, and light off, there is the chance that someone would not pay any 
attention to your wishes and interrupt you without thinking. &quot;Oh the door's 
locked... I'll just knock real hard... that will get his attention....&quot; ;) 

So could this be used? Or would the alerting be too much of an interruption. 
My thinking was that this would allow me the extra time to begin integrating 
back into my physical body before the actual interruption occurred and side 
step some if not all of the effects from being interrupted while separated. 
And if this can be used, would it be better to say impregnate the hallway, 
rather than my room? 

Something else that struck me while I was reading excerpts from Rawn's site, 
is the use of the negative fire element. Bardon says that while accumulating 
the fire element in the body, one could, after much practice, produce a fever. 
Fever being the bodies natural mechanism to fight off bacteria and such, it 
occurred to me that this might be used to say help along the immune system 
fighting a cold ;) Someone might go to class all day without a jacket or coat 
in 30*F whether or something ;) Anyway, if this could be used, would one 
use the positive or negative fire element? I'm guessing that I've been using a 
neutral fire element (so to speak) while performing the accumulation 
exercise. If this is so, I'm assuming all one would need to do is impress the 
visualization with the idea that it would be destructive to bacteria and germs 
and thus would need to use the negative fire element. 

And a final question, this one directed to Rawn specifically: 
<a  href="../WhyPME.html">http://www.abardoncompanion.com/WhyPME.html</a> 
In the correspondance entitled &quot;Why Practice Magical Evocation&quot; you say the 
following: 

&gt;&gt; In other words, the awareness of the expanded Self *must* already be a 
manifest part of the initiate's mundane existence -- it *must* reach ALL the 
way &quot;down&quot; and touch the soil and take root before it can grow upwards. 
Without this rooting, so well provided through Bardonian evocation, the 
crossing *might* succeed (though most likely not) but there would, without a 
doubt, be *no* chance of surviving the subsequent &quot;dark night of the soul&quot;. 
&lt;&lt; 

I was wondering if you could elaborate further on what the &quot;dark night of the 
soul&quot; is or maybe at least why it is experienced. The term sounds familiar but 
I can't recall reading it anywhere or anything of that nature. I've certainly 
never had anyone use it in a conversation before ;) Of course if you can't 
(lack of words or do not wish to) I understand. 

All Will Go Well, 
--Alan
