<pre>Greetings. 

In my experience, given that we all lie, either to ourselves, in our 
ignorance or positively with intent, etc. The focus on more truth and 
less lie reveals ones true intent to oneself and develops courage, 
awareness, strength and far less confusion within as well as without. 
It is also much more difficult to manifest that the *avoiding lie*.

I also believe, lying is our personality based attempt to avoid 
consequence (consequence may smply be the effort required to 
eliminate our self-ignorance in the matter) for our truth (or our 
ignorance) and the avoidance of modifying our delivery of that truth 
with greater compassion for ourselves as well as for others. 

I believe great mysteries are left undiscovered in the midst of our 
lies.

One certainly may accept lying as a fact and a truth of life... to 
UTILIZE this fact as a means to remove our responsibility in refining 
that lie to a lesser lie/closer truth may limit the opportunity 
within the lie and consequently, our own self development. 

IE - it actually prolongs our weakness and dependence upon that lie 
within the illusion of gaining us a temporary optional strength. 

A lie is in itself a lie that we lie to ourselves and suspend our own 
truth (again) to believe long enough to share its desceit with 
another who in turn believes our lie as a truth. 

The theft of something seemingly materially insignificant. That 
judgement compounds the lie again and we avoid determining our real 
truth.

I often reflect that one lie is actually the parent of several at the 
moment of conception. 

There is a place between the light and in the space of 
forgetfullness, avoidance and darkness. 

What habitation does it provide for? What seeks to live and influence 
within our psychies there and remain unseen parts of our 
personalities? Ever influencing and ever evaded? Overlooked and 
forgotten whenever sought. At least at first.

I appreciate your candor.

Thank you.
:T:

&gt; Perhaps you misunderstood. For one thing, I don't consider lying 
to 
&gt; be an inherently negative trait. To speak a falsehood is something 
&gt; that happens; whether or not that has a negative impact on myself 
or 
&gt; others has to do with my awareness, my intent, and the consequences 
&gt; of my actions, all of which can vary.
&gt; 
&gt; And it sounds like you've found your own ways to deal with negative 
&gt; people. Undoubtedly that works for you in situations you encounter.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; David
