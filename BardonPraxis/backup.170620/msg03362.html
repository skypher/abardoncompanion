Dear Dustin,

I have a caffeine addiction, mainly because I'm a computer science 
major and spend late nights programming. But the main point is that 
my addiction is caused by something else, procrastination. If I 
didn't procrastinate, I wouldn't have to stay up late.

You already know why you go for food, but the solution won't lie in 
the food. You'll have to fix those other problems that cause you to 
go to food, and then, when the need for food is at a low, you can 
tackle the food problem.

&gt; Hi, what is the preffered method to deal with
&gt; addictions? I have become addicted to food, and use
&gt; it for emotional support when challenges arise. This
&gt; has become a big problem, but it's going to help a lot
&gt; if folks start laughing at how ridiculous it is. My
&gt; main question: Does it help not to think about the
&gt; problem at all, or to make plans to derail it? Now
&gt; the thoughtform is big and omnious. I will use food
&gt; to avoid emotional confrontation, so any thought about
&gt; being afraid of a certain situation is a link to the
&gt; fear of food. See, Many things in my personal
&gt; inventory have gotten linked up like this, that is why
&gt; I feel trapped in a web. If anyone has experience
&gt; here is the best approach to
&gt; 1. deal with one element at a time?
&gt; 2. use auto suggestion to come to terms with the root
&gt; cause of the guilt. i.e. trouble homelife, or fear of
&gt; becoming a productive member of society, etc.?
&gt; 3. emotionally finding a nurturing source to replace
&gt; the food comfort?
&gt; 4. join a support group, or seek professional help ;-)
&gt; ?
&gt; 5. face it head on by using meal planning etc. 
&gt; 6. fasting periodically
&gt; 
&gt; So far, numbers 5. and 6. seem to work, but when I'm
&gt; under pressure a slight distraction can cause an
&gt; explosion which leads to a long period of indulgence. 
&gt; And it seems as though controlling or repressing it
&gt; actually makes it stronger (even if I don't happen to
&gt; be eating at the time) For example: before this was an
&gt; issue I decided to fast for a weak for the purpose of
&gt; beginning IIH. As I went with less food, and
&gt; experience spiritual food, I felt a guilty attraction
&gt; to going back to the old way. It always started out
&gt; as a sort of morbidness. For example, a few years ago
&gt; I read something that some frater wrote about how his
&gt; biggest challenge was overcoming simple sugur. I
&gt; thought &quot;gee that could very well be me.&quot; Then after
&gt; I ate alot of food once, I can't remember why, I
&gt; thought to myself, &quot;This could become an addiction.&quot; 
&gt; The thought was very quiet and subtle, and I didn't
&gt; really take it seriously. Next, after the problem
&gt; was afoot, I thought , &quot;wow, if this continues it
&gt; could really jeopordize my education&quot; I knew the
&gt; thought was crazy at the time, and I negated it, but
&gt; there was a subconscious alliance, and my thoughts
&gt; became polarized to manifest this tunnel reality. Is
&gt; there a rational reason (for example, learning how to
&gt; be compassionate towards people with challenges) why I
&gt; would do this, or should it be considered a stupid
&gt; irrationality and not given any more importance? The
&gt; more I think about the problem, the stronger it
&gt; becomes, but I am not sure if there is some sort of
&gt; hidden lesson or karma in my past that I can profit
&gt; from now that I am motivated to resolve this. I
&gt; almost considered deleting this, but is has gone on so
&gt; long, I at least need someone to tell me I'm stupid. 
&gt; (in a good-natured way )
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Dustin
