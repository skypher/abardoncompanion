I have read this book and I enjoyed it very much, you get to see how he
lived the things he teaches, how he even made mistakes at times, and
acted very human! I agree with what you said about him living an adepts
life. I always feel inspired after I read it.

A cemetary sounds like a nice place to do evocations. I've always
thought it would be nice to find an old sandstone church to do
evocations in too. :)

&gt; Dear group,
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone from this group gotten this book? I just received it this 
&gt; week and I must say that the book although small is a nice 
&gt; testimonal to the adept.
&gt; 
&gt; I would not mind starting a discussion on the book itself. I found 
&gt; one thing of particular interest. Franz Bardon lived a very modest 
&gt; and quiet life, not to mentain a gentleman. What a contrast to 
&gt; Crowley and Mathers and their like :)
&gt; 
&gt; When you read and study his Practice of evocation towards the end of 
&gt; the book their is a picture of a magician conducting an evocation in 
&gt; a lavish and beautiful temple. Before I read this book I always 
&gt; thought Bardon had at least a huge house in which to have a room 
&gt; dedicated to himself and evocations. In reality Bardon had a small 
&gt; house, sounds like me and it sounds like he had to practice his 
&gt; magick in a small limited space in the house, sounds familar to any 
&gt; of you :) 
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a man that I can truly say lived an adept's life without the 
&gt; self-aggrandiment that many like to live. I also did not know that 
&gt; he conducted many of his evocations in the cemetary. What a place of 
&gt; choice :), but according to those that wrote the book he found it to 
&gt; be a place of most peace and with little or no interruption. 
&gt; 
&gt; Overall I enjoyed the book. My only compliant is that the book is 
&gt; too small(100 pages). I would have liked to have had at least a book 
&gt; of 250-300 pages on Bardon, this book left me wanting to know more 
&gt; about the man.
