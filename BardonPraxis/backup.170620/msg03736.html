Hi, 

I believe the moderator has answered the question with
&quot;..LBRP gives the illusion of sanity by creating a
temporary, artificial equilibrium. It doesn't help
with the task of elemental equipose, but instead
prepares the practitioner with an encounter with the
shadow self.&quot; He said that it could be used for a
short while. In my experience it seems like it
strengthens the will, but it actually deepens the
pre-existing denial system by creating sort of a super
ego. There was an underlying emotional deficit
underlying the false confidence. Leaves me feeling
wired, disconnected, socially atrophied. It didn't
happen for the first few years. . . has anyone else
noticed that it drys you out more as time goes on?

Regards,
Dust

&gt; Rawn:
&gt; 
&gt; I was at first a bit &quot;panicked&quot; when I saw that you
&gt; were stopping 
&gt; the BardonPraxis Forum. I recently joined the Forum,
&gt; and 
&gt; never &quot;dared&quot; submit questions, so I was afraid to
&gt; have missed my 
&gt; opportunity... But then I have been thinking about
&gt; it and must admit 
&gt; that, in fact, I have been able to &quot;feel&quot; an answer
&gt; to many 
&gt; questions by going through your site (and other
&gt; material) and 
&gt; meditating about it (?taking my time. We/I will
&gt; benefit much more by 
&gt; having devoting more time to new material for your
&gt; website... but of 
&gt; course you already knew that...
&gt; 
&gt; This being said, I have a question that has been in
&gt; my mind for 
&gt; several months, and I am not sure what to think
&gt; (feel?)?so I'll go 
&gt; for it... It is related to the practice of rituals
&gt; in combination 
&gt; with IIH. There is no mention of common rituals like
&gt; LBRP in IIH, as 
&gt; is also the case on your website. I actually
&gt; remember reading a 
&gt; comment from you that Bardon mentioned that
&gt; practicing rituals that 
&gt; are not &quot;understood&quot; was in fact sorcery. However, I
&gt; have read the 
&gt; book by Alexandre Moryason &quot;La Lumi&#xE8;re sur la
&gt; Royaume&quot; (in French, 
&gt; my native language), and he specifically recommends
&gt; the practice of 
&gt; LBRP and other Golden Dawn inspired rituals as an
&gt; essential aid to 
&gt; IIH. What should I make of it ?
&gt; 
&gt; I am also disturbed by the fact that various authors
&gt; (Regardie, 
&gt; Kraig, Moryason?) seem to propose different versions
&gt; of LBRP (going 
&gt; first on right or left shoulder,
&gt; names/pronunciation). If these 
&gt; rituals are indeed powerful, then such details
&gt; should not be 
&gt; indifferent ? but then which one is &quot;right&quot;? Is
&gt; there real value in 
&gt; practicing LBRP together with IIH? a &quot;danger&quot; in
&gt; using one version 
&gt; over the other? 
&gt; 
&gt; Warm regards
&gt; 
&gt; Philippe 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;
