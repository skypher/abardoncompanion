&gt; Figured i'd post some ideas that were bouncing around my head, 
&gt; be good to get it all writen down ( and make sure im not way off 
&gt; base ) 
&gt; 
&gt; I was reading some translations of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, 
and 
&gt; thought that it might help me understand the theory section of IIH 
&gt; better ( ok...Bardon starting out the theory section with a quote 
&gt; from it was a little hint..) Basicaly what i got was this:
&gt; 
&gt; Everything came from the one, which im taking to mean the Akasa, 
&gt; since Bardon says that all the elements came from it. Next the 
&gt; tablet says that the Sun was the father of the one, and its mother 
&gt; was the moon, which seemed odd at first since you cant give birth 
to 
&gt; your parents, but I think the Sun represents fire and the Moon 
&gt; represents water. The male force is active, female receptive, and 
&gt; also in my version bardon says &quot; ... must have been fire and light, 
&gt; and in the Bible we read: &quot;Fiat Lux&quot; ? There shall be
&gt; light. The origin of the light, of course, is to be sought in the 
&gt; fire. &quot; about the element of fire, so that reminded me of the sun.  
&gt; 
&gt; next the tablet says that wind only carried the one, and it was 
&gt; never suggested that it played a more active role, so through a 
&gt; briliant leap of deductive reasoning i asociated the element of 
wind 
&gt; with the 'wind' refered to in the tablet. In some versions of the 
&gt; tablet it also says that earth caried the one, but when it does it 
&gt; syas that it carried it within its breast, and the other 
&gt; translations say that the earth nourished the one. So i think that 
&gt; the carried here means two different things for each, the carried 
&gt; for the wind meaning more like it carrying the one along between 
the 
&gt; elements, and for earth meaning carried and nutured inside of it, 
&gt; like the spirit inside of gross matter, the subtle in the gross or 
&gt; the 3 elements interacting to create the 4th one and the tetrepolar 
&gt; magnet.   
&gt; 
&gt; after that it talks about seperating the fire from the earth/subtle 
&gt; from the gross, and many other metaphors for the alchemical 
process. 
&gt; so what i took that to mean in relation to IIH was the process of 
&gt; working on refining the elements. From there the tablet talks about 
&gt; a ascending to the uper and coming back down to the lower, and the 
&gt; subtle and gross joined together to become one. I have next to none 
&gt; experience with the later steps in IIH, so ill leave that as is.
&gt; 
&gt; Now that its all writen out it dosent seem that much of a leap of 
&gt; logic...just hope i took the right leaps. Eh, looking at the tablet 
&gt; and comparing it to the tetrepolar magnet helped me get a little 
&gt; insight into how the elements work together anyway..you know, 
&gt; actualy, i think Bardon's theory section helped me make sense of 
the 
&gt; tablet and not the other way around. Some translations made less 
&gt; sense than my posts ( at least to me anyway ). Well, feel free to 
&gt; tear apart my logic, shouldnt be too hard.
