<pre>Hello Luca
I have found that if people are judmental they will pick on you no 
matter what you do. I have been treated badly for being a woman, 
riding a motorcycle, being fat, and being ill. It all passes with 
time and being angry just gives you high blood pressure after the 
years of stress. You are as bad as they are if you react the way that 
they want you too. They are placing you in a spot in their reality. 
Most of us are not what others expect or try to force us into being. 
It also makes it so you attract other things to make you angry and 
trap yourself in a cycle. It is like being a hamster in a wheel going 
40 miles an hour and ending up in the same place when you are done.
The only thing I have found that helps is to do Metta meditation 
and send loving-kindness to yourself. To Forgive yourself for putting 
yourself in the situation where the things happened that upset you.
IIH is really good for you because in the Soul mirror work you can 
see your personality and change what you don't like. You can only 
control yourself and what you do in this life. Anger, ego, pride, 
hate and ignorance are some of the worse things that can hold you 
back from enjoying life and liking yourself. You can't make anyone 
else see what you were saying or try to understand something they 
don't want to understand. You can only make it where you like 
yourself and know yourself as a real person.

&gt; The problem is that I'm _not_ better than them - the reason that I get
&gt; so angry isn't because they're doing this to me, or even that they're
&gt; doing it to others, but the reasons that they're doing it - like I
&gt; said, as far as they're concerned, existence is invalidated because of
&gt; something you're born with, like your race or gender.
&gt; 
&gt; But, unfortunately, everyone's right - there's nothing I can do to
&gt; change them. I just wish that I could render them ineffective as far
&gt; as affecting others, but laws prevent that; if I were to talk
&gt; peacefully with the gay man, he would have me effectively ostracised
&gt; because I'm homophobic, or something to that effect. To use my native
&gt; colloquialism, it pisses me off to see that the law condones their
&gt; discrimination of me for being a heterosexual male while protecting
&gt; them from me because they're homosexual or female. Or both, in some
&gt; cases. I want to give them justice, or empathy for what they're doing,
&gt; but that's beyond me, at least for the moment...
&gt; 
&gt; But like I said - you're all right. The only thing I can do right now
&gt; is realize that they're the ones being stupid and find some way to
&gt; defend myself if they target me, and then spread that bit of knowledge
&gt; among others. Thanks for your help - I'll probably be posting more
&gt; once I get this resolved.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again,
&gt;
