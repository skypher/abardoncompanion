Hi again Geoffrey,
Yes Rawn is correct and I'd like to appologise for the confusion but 
I got confused as well because of your lines :
&quot;&gt;Regarding the one pointedness after I return from emptiness, what 
I focus upon? should I focus upon the period I went into emptiness 
in the sense that the blank there will become meaningful thoughts? 

Again my appologies I will be more careful next time.
More power to all.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I am confused. :) From what I understand from Bardon's book in 
&gt; the Emptiness of Mind, is that I should resist with all my strength 
&gt; from thoughts are coming in. I think there is a line where it is 
&gt; stated somethign like that. Rawn, did I understand Bardon 
&gt; correctly? 
&gt; 
&gt; But from Pedro's perspective is I have to let the thoughts just 
come 
&gt; in. Although not attached to it. But seemingly Pedro attach a 
&gt; special meaning to the thoughts coming in. as this line:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Your thoughts will become more &quot;meaningful&quot; as you progress in 
the 
&gt; &gt; study.
&gt; 
&gt; From my perspective, maybe I am doing a similar thing with what 
Pedro 
&gt; is saying but not entirely similar. Whenever a thought arises, I 
&gt; just shift my focus out of it by not thinking of it - &quot;not attached 
&gt; to it&quot;. And later on the thought just disappear because no 
thinking 
&gt; process is being given to it. And of course, another thought will 
&gt; come in, and I just do it again. Shifting my focus out. But by 
doing 
&gt; this, I don't care about the thoughts coming in. So I don't think 
&gt; even meaningful thoughts will come in. Because I shift out of the 
&gt; thoughts everytime.
&gt; 
&gt; And just a question too, is there a maximum length to be devoted to 
&gt; the Emptiness of Mind exercise everyday (like 30 minutes?)? 
&gt; 
&gt; Paul, how do you practise it in the office?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Geoffrey

&gt; &gt; Hi Geoffrey, 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is unsolicited , with all due respect to all, I'd just like 
to 
&gt; &gt; add a little something. Just let it happen. From what I have 
&gt; learned, 
&gt; &gt; the idea of learning to &quot;let go&quot; of your thoughts is for us to 
&gt; learn 
&gt; &gt; not to end up forcing concepts and ideas into the practice to be 
&gt; able 
&gt; &gt; to get results. That was why he said &quot;to be a silent observer&quot;. 
&gt; This 
&gt; &gt; is a natural tendency of a person in the study - to be expecting 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; results or effects of the practice. At this early stage, the 
&gt; student 
&gt; &gt; is likely to simulate experiences where later on in the study it 
&gt; &gt; might be the cause of a stagnation. I fell into the trap before 
&gt; when 
&gt; &gt; I was so eager to get results and be able to say something to my 
&gt; &gt; guide. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Your thoughts will become more &quot;meaningful&quot; as you progress in 
the 
&gt; &gt; study.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; During this stage, just learn to focus and extend the duration of 
&gt; &gt; this focus. Breathing properly is of utmost importance.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope I worded it properly that you got my point and that I was 
&gt; able 
&gt; &gt; to help you in any way.
