<pre>Dear forestofsymbols,

Many thanks for your message.

&lt;&lt;it sounds like you might be confusing the elements
(fire, water, earth, air, and ether) and the levels
(physical, astral, mental). &gt;&gt;

I re-read my message, and I understand your feeling
:-). English is not my mother tongue (as you may have
guessed :-) and the following sentence, particularly,
could have been written more carefully :
-----
does the &quot;shaping&quot; of the raw energy issued by Fire
take place at the Water level ?
-----
What I meant was simply &quot;is the raw energy issued by
Fire shaped by Water&quot;.
In spite of my clumsly wording, I don't have the
feeling I made a confusion between Elements and Planes
(...although physical corresponds to the Earth
Element, astral to the Water Element, Mental to the
Fire Element etc., ... and knowing that Astral is an
intermediary between Mental and Physical. Aarghh.
Just wanted to ensure I confused everybody :-) :-)

Given the correspondance just mentionned above, I was
tempted to answer myself &quot;yes&quot; to my own question
(does water give form to Fire). But I'm still not
sure.

The question I asked is valid for all planes, not only
the physical one.

&lt;&lt;It might help if rather than thinking of these
things in the abstract, you find some experiences to
tie them to, to make them real for yourself. &gt;&gt;

Can you elaborate, please ? I'm interested in all
possible ways to improve my meditations on the
Elements - and the questions they raise. Thanks in
advance.

Greetings
NB

&gt; alone. It might

&gt; This was my own mistake as I've recently discovered.

&gt; &gt; Oops. Here are a few sentences I forgot to
&gt; include. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know that the actual *solidification* (&quot;let it
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; done&quot;) takes place at the Earth Element -
&gt; &gt; electromagnetic level.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My question is not about this level:
&gt; solidification is
&gt; &gt; distinct from shaping IMHO. My question is really
&gt; &gt; about the original &quot;Intention/Design&quot; : does the
&gt; &gt; &quot;shaping&quot; of the raw energy issued by Fire take
&gt; place
&gt; &gt; at the Water level ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; May sound confusing (and confused) to the other
&gt; &gt; students. I apologize ...but I still need to know,
&gt; &gt; because till now I believed that Water was
&gt; &gt; &quot;shrinking&quot;, so to speak, something already formed
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; solidified at another level, but I did not imagine
&gt; &gt; that it was taking a role in the shaping process.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ok. I'll stop worsening my case :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Many thanks

&gt; &gt; &gt; In Rawn's comments on IIH, I read in the &quot;Theory
&gt; &gt; &gt; Section&quot;: 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;The magnetic Fluid *gives form* to the
&gt; Electric
&gt; &gt; &gt; force&gt;&gt; (emphasis 
&gt; &gt; &gt; mine). 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Taking this literally, meaning that the creation
&gt; &gt; &gt; deriving from the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Electric force takes actual shape through the
&gt; &gt; &gt; influence of the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; magnetic Fluid, is it possible to infer that
&gt; Water
&gt; &gt; &gt; gives form to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fire ? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; a) Superficially this looked obvious to me given
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; attributes of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the respective Elements. But suddenly I was not
&gt; sure
&gt; &gt; &gt; this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; was &quot;licit&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; b) Since *Water* somewhat looks like an
&gt; &gt; &gt; instantiation of the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; *Magnetic* Fluid or its concrete manifestation
&gt; &gt; &gt; (sorry - I don't find 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the words), and the equivalent for Fire, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; deduction seems logical 
&gt; &gt; &gt; from that angle also
&gt; &gt; &gt; At the same time, since they are not at the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; level, and given 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the explicit additional attributes of Water and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fire, I was not sure 
&gt; &gt; &gt; this was authorized.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; What is correct ? Or am I &quot;pedaling besides the
&gt; &gt; &gt; bicycle&quot; :-) ? Or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; should I wait till level 8 :-( ?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Many thanks.
