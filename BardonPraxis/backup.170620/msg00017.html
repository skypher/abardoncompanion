<pre>I hope the group will forgive the somewhat rambling style of this 
posting. I have been working on Step 1 of IIH for about two months 
now and I have been thinking about Mental Plane magick (conscious 
intake of breath and Eucharist Magick).

As I understand it, Hermetics teaches that humans exist on a Mental 
Plane, an Emotional Plane (the astral?) and of course, the good old 
Physical Plane. As multi-level beings we can influence reality on 
all three planes and the changes on one plane affect the other 
planes (to varying degrees). Advanced Hermetic practitioners have 
integrated the three levels within themselves and can affect the 
three Planes all at once or individually. We beginners on the other 
hand don't usually manage much inter-plane interaction either 
internally or externally. I suspect that one of the reasons Franz 
Bardon starts us off with Mental Plane magick so early in our 
studies is to begin the process of opening the channels that link 
the planes within ourselves. 

When I read Step 1 I was struck by the fact that the four suggested 
exercises in Mental Plane magick are all focused on making changes 
within oneself (I think that's a kind of magick called &quot;Theurgy&quot;). 
The other flavor of magick (Thaumaturgy ? literally &quot;wonder 
working&quot;) concerns magickal influence of the external world. 

I am guessing that Bardon starts us off with Theurgical exercises 
because (a) it's more likely to work with the relatively weak 
capabilities of most beginners, and (b) there are no ethical issues 
concerning other people's free will and so on (I imagine this is 
particularly important while we are still struggling to transform 
our personal negative traits).

Nevertheless, I was wondering what Rawn (and others) thought of 
beginners trying to use Step 1 magickal practices to make changes in 
the external world. For example, I would currently like to expand my 
social circle (I have quite a few friends already but I'm very 
social and get particular pleasure when new people enter my life). 
In addition to the usual mundane efforts in support of that goal I 
was wondering if it would be advisable to &quot;put out a mental call&quot; 
through the Akasha inviting (on the Mental Plane) others into my 
life who have the potential to become new friends.

If this is an advisable use of Step 1 magick, how would I go about 
doing it? Should I imprint the Akasha of the air around me with 
the &quot;call&quot; or should I try to visualize the mental plane (perhaps as 
some misty realm) and use my will to send out my call though that 
level of reality? Does anyone have any suggestions?

Best Regards /RM/

P.S. If any of my assumptions and conjectures are in error I would 
be grateful for correction.
