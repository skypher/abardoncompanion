<pre> I forgot to thank you for your comments last question around 
Rawn, iv made it a habit to do more research on my own before i go 
looking for help..hopefuly that way ill make sure iv got a decent 
understanding of Bardon's views on the subject. I was wondering 
though, to what extent should practical workings play a part in 
magical development? To be honest, i dont think iv done a single 
ritual or working aimed towards a practical result since starting 
IIH, not counting the exercises in IIH. While you could say the 
results from those exercises are practical, the benefits seem to be 
almost side effects from the gradual rise of initiation. I know im 
not explaining this as best as I could, but it seems like im 
becoming more tuned in to how the universe works, and becoming more 
alert and aware. Also, it seems the more I progress with IIH the 
less I want to be able to do the host of things comonly listed as 
practical magick. Specificly the awe inspiring powers like 
levitation, or telekenisis, or making a fireball. It seems to me 
that the only worthwhile 'powers' to go after or use are the ones 
that would either help someone withought interfering in their karma, 
or if the powers use/mastery would help your spiritual development. 
The downside to this is that, especialy since im only at the tail 
end of the second step, ill be feeling like i could do something, 
but having no idea what to do. Hmm.. *slaps forehead* TMO, forgot 
about TMO since this isn't the TMO forum. And I was just talking 
about how im more mentaly alert, too. I think the source of my 
confusion is that post IIH I was learning magick to be able to 
influence the world, but now im becoming more and more aware of the 
Initiation aspect of IIH and the development of the three bodys. To 
sum this sprawling monster up, I think I should just speak frankly 
on the topic of magick powers. Most people new to magick or seeking 
proof of magick want some hard impossible to explain phenomenon ( of 
course we know that nothing in hermetics can violate the laws..*end 
brown nosing*) and cite the absence of those phenomenon as proof 
that magick is just a bunch of make believe. To me it seems like 
people only gain the capacity to do something like that when theyve 
matured to a point where they would never do it. OK, this is 
changing from a question email to a rant really quickly, but it'll 
be good to get this off my chest, and im sure if anyone comments on 
it it'll provide me with food for thought. So, what im trying to 
say, and failing repeatedly, is why? Why bother trying to do things 
like create fire in the material world? You could say that duh, they 
have obvious practical benefits. However, it seems like everything 
we experience is for a reason and to teach us something, so whos to 
say that solving the problem via magick would rob you of a lesson 
you needed to learn this time around? Or heres a scenario to think

Hi Newbie,
=20
If your having your bath / shower with very cold water everyday a'la step 1=
