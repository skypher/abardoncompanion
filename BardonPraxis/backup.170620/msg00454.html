&gt; Based on what you say then, I'd be very grateful if
&gt; you could tell me where I can get a pdf. of the
&gt; English version of The Practice of Magical Evocation?
&gt; Thanks

&gt; Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some copyright rules from the Gutenberg
&gt; project webpage.
&gt; It looks as though we have to wait a few more years
&gt; before Bardons
&gt; material becomes public domain.
&gt; 
&gt; In saying that though it still should not stop anyone
&gt; who is in need
&gt; of the material from obtaining it simply because they
&gt; cannot afford
&gt; it or it is not available to them.
&gt; 
&gt; So instead of 'looking' for a copy simply ask and I am
&gt; sure you will
&gt; find someone obliging to forward you a copy.
&gt; 
&gt; Rawn, you might want to put a small note in the files
&gt; section about
&gt; this, if new people join the list and do not know
&gt; where to obtain the
&gt; material this would help. Although not being a lawyer
&gt; I don't know
&gt; whether that would be an infringement also.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, as I said people only have to ask and I am
&gt; sure, positive,
&gt; damn well 150% certain! that someone will be
&gt; forthcoming with the
&gt; material....;)
&gt; 
&gt; Kind Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Scott.
&gt; 
&gt; United States Public Domain and Copyright Rules
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Works first published before January 1, 1923 with
&gt; proper copyright
&gt; notice entered the public domain no later than 75
&gt; years from the date
&gt; copyright was first secured. Hence, all works whose
&gt; copyrights were
&gt; secured before 1923 are now in the public domain.
&gt; 
&gt; (This is the rule Project Gutenberg uses most often)
&gt; 
&gt; Works published from 1923-1977 retain copyright for 95
&gt; years. No such
&gt; works will enter the public domain until 2019.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Works first created on or after January 1, 1978
&gt; enter the public
&gt; domain 70 years after the death of the author if the
&gt; author is a
&gt; natural person.
&gt; 
&gt; (Nothing will enter the public domain under this rule
&gt; until at least
&gt; January 1, 2049.)
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Works first created on or after January 1, 1978
&gt; which are created
&gt; by a corporate author enter the public domain 95 years
&gt; after
&gt; publication or 120 years after creation whichever
&gt; occurs first.
&gt; 
&gt; (Nothing will enter the public domain under this rule
&gt; until at least
&gt; January 1, 2074.)
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Works created before January 1, 1978 but not
&gt; published before that
&gt; date are copyrighted under rules 2 and 3 above, except
&gt; that in no
&gt; case will the copyright on a work not published prior
&gt; to January 1,
&gt; 1978 expire before December 31, 2002. If the work is
&gt; published before
&gt; December 31, 2002, its copyright will not expire
&gt; before December 31,
&gt; 2047.
&gt; 
&gt; (This rule copyrights a lot of manuscripts that we
&gt; would otherwise
&gt; think of as public domain because of their age.)
&gt; 
&gt; 5. If a substantial number of copies were printed and
&gt; distributed in
&gt; the U.S. prior to March 1, 1989 without a copyright
&gt; notice, and the
&gt; work is of entirely American authorship, or was first
&gt; published in
&gt; the United States, the work is in the public domain in
&gt; the U.S.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. (This rule is complicated, and is seldom applied).
&gt; Works published
&gt; before 1964 needed to have their copyrights renewed in
&gt; their 28th
&gt; year, or they'd enter into the public domain. Some
&gt; books originally
&gt; published outside of the US by non-Americans are
&gt; exempt from this
&gt; requirement, under GATT. Works from before 1964 were
&gt; automatically
&gt; renewed if ALL of these apply:
&gt; 
&gt; At least one author was a citizen or resident of a
&gt; foreign country
&gt; (outside the US) that's a party to the applicable
&gt; copyright
&gt; agreements. (Almost all countries are parties to these
&gt; agreements.)
&gt; The work was still under copyright in at least one
&gt; author's &quot;home
&gt; country&quot; at the time the GATT copyright agreement went
&gt; into effect
&gt; for that country (January 1, 1996 for most countries).
&gt; 
&gt; The work was first published abroad, and not published
&gt; in the United
&gt; States until at least 30 days after its first
&gt; publication abroad.
&gt; If you can prove that one of the above does not apply,
&gt; AND if you can
&gt; prove that copyright was not renewed, then the work is
&gt; in the public
&gt; domain.
&gt; 
&gt; To prove an item was not renewed, you need to do an
&gt; extensive search
&gt; of renewals in Library of Congress records (or you
&gt; could get a letter
&gt; from the author or publisher attesting that there was
&gt; no renewal).
&gt; 
&gt; Please read the document about copyright renewal
&gt; online at:
&gt; <a  href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/renewals.html">http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/renewals.html</a>
&gt; before attempting
&gt; to prove public domain status of a work published
&gt; between 1923-1963.
&gt; We have a separate &quot;Rule 6 HOW-TO&quot; for working under
&gt; &quot;Rule 6&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Caveat: Each edition of a work may have its own period
&gt; of copyright
&gt; protection (this depends on whether the new edition
&gt; involves &quot;authorship&quot; or simply corrects punctuation).
&gt; Every
&gt; translation has independent copyright protection. A
&gt; new edition does
&gt; not extend the protection of the original edition.
&gt; 
&gt; Public Domain and Copyright Rules for the United
&gt; Kingdom and many
&gt; other countries.
&gt; The general rule is life of the author plus 70 years
&gt; (previously life
&gt; plus 50 years, but globalization of copyright laws and
&gt; pressure from
&gt; content owners has changed this in most countries). No
&gt; other major
&gt; country has required copyright notice, and placed
&gt; works without
&gt; notice in the public domain. Rules on corporate
&gt; authors differ.
&gt; 
&gt; Whose law applies?
&gt; When we distribute in the United States, U.S. law
&gt; applies. When we
&gt; distribute to other countries, their law applies. That
&gt; is why Peter
&gt; Pan is marked for US distribution only. It is public
&gt; domain in the
&gt; U.S. but not in the U.K.
&gt; 
&gt; What changes have taken place in the term of copyright
&gt; protection in
&gt; the United States?
&gt; Under the 1909 Copyright Act, the original term lasted
&gt; 28 years (not
&gt; 26). It was renewable for an extra 28 years, for a
&gt; total of 56 years.
&gt; Until 1992, the work would enter the public domain if
&gt; renewal was not
&gt; filed in a timely manner. However, even with diligent
&gt; research, it is
&gt; very difficult to determine with assurance that
&gt; renewal was not
&gt; filed.
&gt; In the mid 1950's Congress started working on a major
&gt; revision of the
&gt; copyright act, but by 1960 it was clear that this
&gt; would not be a
&gt; short process. By 1962, everything published before
&gt; 1906 was in the
&gt; public domain. It was clear that the new act would
&gt; grant existing
&gt; works a total term of 75 years. To prevent these works
&gt; from losing
&gt; out on the 75 year extension while Congress worked out
&gt; all the other
&gt; details of the new act, Congress started passing
&gt; extension acts in
&gt; 1962. Such extensions prevented copyright expirations
&gt; before the
&gt; passage of the 1976 Copyright Act, with the result
&gt; that all
&gt; copyrights in existence in 1962 were extended to at
&gt; least 1976 when
&gt; the 75-year term kicked in.
&gt; 
&gt; Effective in 1998, after works first published in 1922
&gt; had passed
&gt; into the public domain, the copyright term was
&gt; extended for all works
&gt; as to which copyright protection had not yet expired.
&gt; For works
&gt; published in 1923, and thereafter (provided they were
&gt; renewed, or
&gt; were exempt from renewal requirements). Thus, the
&gt; effective term will
&gt; be 95 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The rules on public speeches, musical performances,
&gt; and other works
&gt; not originally fixed in a tangible medium of
&gt; expression are
&gt; confusing, and require a determination based on the
&gt; facts of the
&gt; individual instance.
&gt; 
&gt; Rule of Thumb: Published before 1923 or published at
&gt; least 75 years
&gt; ago in the U.S. OR published 50 years after the
&gt; author's death in
&gt; some countries, 70 years after death in others.
