<pre>Dear Peter,

&gt;&gt; (1) Within Jewish Kabalah, do the sepheroth have planetary
associations? I know that the seven doubles have planetary associations,
but I'm not too sure about the sepheroth. &lt;&lt;

Essentially, no. But by inference, yes. It's more that the planets are
associated with the Sephirot than that the Sephirot are associated with
the planets.

&gt;&gt; (2) When Bardon talks about the Eathsphere, Moonsphere, et al, is he
talking about the various sepheroth of the tree of life? &lt;&lt;

Yes! :) :) :)

&gt;&gt; (3) Exactly how important is sequence within the various steps?
Personally I was working through the step three mental exercises upon
the imagry of the tarot card of the World. While doing as such I was
suddenly 'sucked' into the image of the woman within the tarot card,
and started to experience the tarot card from the perspective of this
woman, complete with all of the physiological and emotional
experiences. In addition to the knowledge of what the imagry of this
woman is all about. And so on and so forth. This would seem to be
diving really deep into the step four exercises and does show how the
exercises of one step flow seamlessly into the next... &lt;&lt;

There is a big difference between a spontaneous experience such as
you've described and being able to accomplish the same thing by act of
will and with intention and consistency. This is where adhering to the
sequence comes into play.

We each incarnate with unique abilities and many of these emerge during
the Bardon work. This doesn't however, mean that those native abilities
don't need further training in order to become reliable faculties.

&gt;&gt; (4) On the subject of sequence, within your commentary, Rawn, you say
that there is a long and complicated reason for why Bardon puts the
exercises in the sequence that he does. Primarily in association with
the sequence of the elements and senses that are worked upon. So, care
to put forth the long and complicated reasons for this? &lt;&lt;

No, not particularly. It would be too convoluted for me to write it
clearly at present (and too time consuming).

&gt;&gt; (5) When you create an good visualization, it naturally creates a
connection with the astral counterpart of what is being visualized,
correct? Now from my experience this connection can be used to create
a transference of consciousness. However, I'm not quite sure how to
create a transference of consciousness with an object that is before
the eyes as it where. Which, again, seems to go against the line of
progression within step four that Bardon puts forth within step four. &lt;&lt;

With a visualization, you have the advantage of already being &quot;inside&quot;
it since you are, in effect, creating the visualization around your
center of awareness. With the transference into a non-self-created
thing, you must externalize your awareness and then relocate your
awareness into the thing. This is only slightly different than
relocating your focus to your own foot, for example.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
