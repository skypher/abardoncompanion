<pre>Dear Rawn,

In
&gt; other words, damage to the violet cord specifically, arises when the
&gt; experience rudely exceeds ones level of understanding in an
&gt; out-of-control fashion.


Now, considering a person goes off to a meditational retreat 
and &quot;over exerts&quot; themselves, or they have a severe degree of 
schizophrenia just because of the physiology of their brain -- How 
could they come to an understanding of the experience so that it 
doesn't shake them into delusion? 

What I am thinking here is almost like a slow form of initiation for 
psychiatric patients where a person is in a psychiatric facility, and 
they are having schizophrenic tendencies. This person is given the 
medication and the counseling but is also introduced to a new form of 
learning -philosophically maybe-, which is, on a whole, much more 
holistic.

In short, How do we go about in trying to help repair a violet cord 
that is severely damaged for someone that has their own psychiatric 
dillema that is an inherent trait or brought on by severe trauma or 
drugs?
So far, with some of the people that I have tried to help, the 
things that I do to try to help seem to be specific for each person. 
I am having difficulty in looking at it in a universal manner where I 
can systematically put things down into a system of steps that will 
work for many people in a more efficient manner.

On a lighter note; its strange for me because, with where I live and 
all the psychotic/neurotic people, I can perfectly understand why 
someone would shower for 8 hours a day scrubbing at themselves trying 
to get off the &quot;venomous aphids&quot; that are infecting them, storing 
bottles of these nasty little insects. I guess I am influenced by 
the people I am around. hee hee

&gt; Dear Louis,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; There were some posts a while back that dealt with what happens
&gt; hermetically when one uses different kinds of drugs. I was 
wondering if
&gt; using LSD would cause as much damage to the violet cord if one were 
to
&gt; have the mental tenacity to not be filled with delusion while being
&gt; intoxicated. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; While one would still experience the same physical effects, the 
mental
&gt; effect, and therefore any damage to the violet cord which 
integrates the
&gt; solitary mental body with the astral body, could be negated through 
a
&gt; high degree of mental awareness and discipline. However, such a 
degree
&gt; of mental discipline presupposes the ability to create these mental
&gt; states (actually, states superior to drug induced states) for 
oneself
&gt; without the ingestion of LSD. It's this ability and the fact that 
one
&gt; would be well aware of the significance of these states and familiar
&gt; with them in advance, that subverts any damage to the violet cord. 
In
&gt; other words, damage to the violet cord specifically, arises when the
&gt; experience rudely exceeds ones level of understanding in an
&gt; out-of-control fashion.
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
