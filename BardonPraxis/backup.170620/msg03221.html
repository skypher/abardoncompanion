First off, I can only tell you of my own experiences with the system, 
but I cannot speak for the others, only for myself. As you were 
astounded and overwhelmed by all the possibilities so was I at the 
beginning. However, as I started traveling along the path of the 
unknown, other things made themselves known to my mind's eye. I 
started to see the world differently from the way other people saw 
it. I must say, at first, I found the experiences astounding and an 
eye opening experience. There are other powers at play here. Powers 
which others don't wish to speak of; I don't know ? I guess out of 
fear which is the mind killer ? for fear can diminish a person 
abilities swiftly. I am sure you have had such experiences when 
approaching a matter(s) with fear. Let me start answering your 
questions: You want to know if the abilities presented in the Bardon 
Books were attainable. I would say some of them are, but if you are 
expecting &quot;Mandrake the Magician spectaculars,&quot; then I would say no.  
I feel to attain some of the possibilities in Bardon's system there 
are certain requirements one should be willing to meet, unless the 
individual is a natural like the Frabato, which I am not. All that 
clairvoyance stuff is true. I for one have witnessed foreseen events 
in horror and was not able to do anything to about it; astral travel 
is also true; the reincarnation stuff also true. I really don't know 
if Bardon was Lao Tse and the others; I have never tested that area 
of Bardon's life and I don't like to take a person's words as the 
final revelation, testament and judgment on the matter. As for 
possibilities of making an imagination appear to the physical eyes or 
imagined sound to the hearing; all that is possible. In regards to 
money, I have tested those waters, and I would be careful. Bear in 
mind, money is a man-made device by design. Remember, for every 
cause there is an effect; causality. Make sure you do your research 
before testing the uncharted waters of moneymaking using magic. As 
for the &quot;making gold thing&quot;, I would give up on that. There are only 
a few, real McCoy, Alchemist, remaining on our world and they refuse 
to let themselves be known. It would be nice if someone out there who 
would be brave enough to write a simplified version of magical 
steps/attainments, thus cutting away all the areas of &quot;enigmas&quot; which 
has stalled many of us on the path of our magical evolution. It's 
just like the age of the typewriter vs. the computer; are we willing 
to make that change?

&gt; Just as long as I achieve basic results I can know that the whole 
&gt; thing is real and it's just a matter of time to reach the other 
&gt; abilities. That's basically all I need to get to.
&gt; 
&gt; What have you been able to achieve and how did you do it, and also 
&gt; how long did it take?

&gt; &gt; When I first read the Bardon material, I was astounded and 
&gt; overwhelmed by all the possibilities, but I also realized that this 
&gt; work will take a very long time.
&gt; &gt; It may take a lifetime of many lifetimes to achieve what one 
&gt; wants to, but this is only a short time (and the most important) in 
&gt; the scheme of eternity.

&gt; &gt; Hello Ardesir,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have dealt with Bardon's System for the past 16 years - 
&gt; &gt; with &quot;some&quot; success. Some of the techniques I found to be 
&gt; &gt; attainable. What in specific do you want to know? For 
&gt; example: Can 
&gt; &gt; one change one life's situation for the better? Can it get one 
&gt; out 
&gt; &gt; of debt? Can it make one safe? Can it make one more 
&gt; intelligent?  
&gt; &gt; Can it make one immortal? I guess what I am trying to find out 
&gt; from 
&gt; &gt; you first is what do you want to attain because a lot of 
&gt; individuals 
&gt; &gt; approach the Bardon's System expecting to have the world at 
&gt; their 
&gt; &gt; command. Let me know, and I will respond.
&gt; &gt;
