<pre>Hi,

(My views follow, some thoughts to mull over, grist for the mill so they
say)

There is much debate over the 'value' of classic alchemical texts. First of
all, many alchemical texts were written by people who already knew alchemy
and (it is said) wrote more to show that they knew the process, and let
other alchemists know that they knew. So, it is claimed, often they missed
important steps in the process out, or they mixed some of the steps around,
so those who don't know what they're doing cannot follow them. And of course
much was written in allegorical language, and it can be difficult to tell
which is being spoken plainly and straight up, and which is being alluded
to, or described by extended metaphor (unless you already know the secret).

Secondly, there is debate over who actually 'knew' the 'right' way, or any
way at all.

If you read the article on the Ingaleses, entitled &quot;Did they confect the
philosophers stone&quot;
(<a  href="http://www.crow-caw.com/TPS%20Pages/Articles/INGALESE.TXT">http://www.crow-caw.com/TPS%20Pages/Articles/INGALESE.TXT</a>) Richard Ingalese
is quoted as having stated that he agreed with the statement: &quot;Some one has
said, 'You can destroy all other books on alchemy, for their knowledge and
more is contained in the alchemical writings of Paracelsus.&quot; Mrs Ingalese
told the Occult Review's Mrs McKenzie that A. E. Waite's edition of _The
Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus_ were &quot;the volumes that
afforded her the most encouragement and help in her subsequent efforts.&quot;

If you look at Pernety's &quot;The Great Art&quot;
(<a  href="http://www.geocities.com/librorumprohibitorum/pernety-the-great-art.htm">http://www.geocities.com/librorumprohibitorum/pernety-the-great-art.htm</a>)
You will find his thoughts on arriving at 'the Secret':

&quot;Of the Means of Arriving at the Secret

The requirements necessary in order to arrive at this Secret, are: the
knowledge of Nature and of one's self. One may not understand the first
perfectly, or even the second, without the aid of Alchemy. The love of
wisdom, the horror of crime, and of falsehood, the avoidance of
cacochemists, the association of the wise, the invocation of the Holy
Spirit; not to add secret to secret, to attach one's self only to one thing
(because God and Nature delight in unity and simplicity), such are the
conditions necessary for obtaining the divine revelation.

Man being the epitome of all Nature, must learn to know himself as the
summary, the miniature of Nature. By his spiritual part he is allied to all
immortal creatures, and by his material part, to all that which is transient
in the Universe.&quot;

If you do intend to work your way through the classic alchemical texts, then
I highly recommend reading Pernety, as he helps describe the world of
hermetic philosophy through which many of the classic alchemists wrote about
their works.

Regardie's &quot;Philosophers Stone&quot; (available from
<a  href="http://www.geocities.com/librorumprohibitorum/">http://www.geocities.com/librorumprohibitorum/</a> ) is another good way to get
aquainted with Hermetic Philosophy as it relates to alchemical texts.
However it was written at a time when Regardie believed the texts to only
relate to spiritual matters, and said laboratory alchemy was a load of old
cobblers. (Later he studying alchemy from Frater Albertus).

Another recommended technique I've seen (which makes sense from a magical
perspective) is to read all you can about the life and times of the
alchemist whose text you wish to study. Then meditate on the alchemist. In
you inner mind assume their energy, and see yourself reading books on
alchemy, working in the lab, making realisations, etc, etc... being as
creative as you can about the whole process. From this, you can assist your
learning about the process. If you have someone to work with you (who knows
Hypnosis or related trance processes) perhaps they can guide you in this
process.

Also, don't overlook modern books such as Herbert Stanley Redgrove's
&quot;Alchemy: Ancient and Modern ( <a  href="http://www.hermetics.org/ebooks.html">http://www.hermetics.org/ebooks.html</a> ) which
also contains brief biographies of some of the classical alchemists. There
is also plenty of thoughts (pro and contra) which can arise after reading
modern alchemists' views on the classic texts. There are various groups on
Yahoo dedicated to alchemy, and some of the practicing alchemists are
willing to teach you what they know, but often they will require some
committment from you in the beginning, such as obtaining labware and doing
some of the herbal work (with little assistance) to &quot;prove your worth&quot;
(perhaps) ... at very least most of them seem to have a low tolerance to
time wasters (can't blame them really).

Finally, I know the address of Adam McLean's site has already been posted
but I thought it would be worthwhile mentioning that there is also a mirror
site located at: <a  href="http://www.alchemywebsite.com/">http://www.alchemywebsite.com/</a> (easier to remember).

Cheers,
Graeme
