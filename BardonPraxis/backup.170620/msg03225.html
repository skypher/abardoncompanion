Thanks for your reply and for your help. Others like Rawn believe 
that all the abilities in the Bardon books are possible, but I've 
also heard the same as your's from many other sources. For instance 
from Wiccan books and sites I've read that the usual feats we think 
of when we think of magic aren't true and magic to them more subtle. 
Probably something like Gandalf's magic as opposed to the emperor's 
lightening projections in Star Wars.

I'm aslo interested in the idea of a magical society if the one's 
who have the attained the most would help others. Bardon mentions 
the idea in Frabato the Magician where he talks about the FOGC lodge 
trying to discredit the idea of the occult and the fear of what the 
change in society that would result if occult knowledge was common. 
Eventhough Bardon intended his books to take the place of teachers I 
think most people would benefit from teaching and might actually 
need it. Because most times not everyone can learn on their own.

&gt; First off, I can only tell you of my own experiences with the 
system, 
&gt; but I cannot speak for the others, only for myself. As you were 
&gt; astounded and overwhelmed by all the possibilities so was I at the 
&gt; beginning. However, as I started traveling along the path of the 
&gt; unknown, other things made themselves known to my mind's eye. I 
&gt; started to see the world differently from the way other people saw 
&gt; it. I must say, at first, I found the experiences astounding and 
an 
&gt; eye opening experience. There are other powers at play here.  
Powers 
&gt; which others don't wish to speak of; I don't know ? I guess out of 
&gt; fear which is the mind killer ? for fear can diminish a person 
&gt; abilities swiftly. I am sure you have had such experiences when 
&gt; approaching a matter(s) with fear. Let me start answering your 
&gt; questions: You want to know if the abilities presented in the 
Bardon 
&gt; Books were attainable. I would say some of them are, but if you 
are 
&gt; expecting &quot;Mandrake the Magician spectaculars,&quot; then I would say 
no.  
&gt; I feel to attain some of the possibilities in Bardon's system 
there 
&gt; are certain requirements one should be willing to meet, unless the 
&gt; individual is a natural like the Frabato, which I am not. All 
that 
&gt; clairvoyance stuff is true. I for one have witnessed foreseen 
events 
&gt; in horror and was not able to do anything to about it; astral 
travel 
&gt; is also true; the reincarnation stuff also true. I really don't 
know 
&gt; if Bardon was Lao Tse and the others; I have never tested that 
area 
&gt; of Bardon's life and I don't like to take a person's words as the 
&gt; final revelation, testament and judgment on the matter. As for 
&gt; possibilities of making an imagination appear to the physical eyes 
or 
&gt; imagined sound to the hearing; all that is possible. In regards 
to 
&gt; money, I have tested those waters, and I would be careful. Bear 
in 
&gt; mind, money is a man-made device by design. Remember, for every 
&gt; cause there is an effect; causality. Make sure you do your 
research 
&gt; before testing the uncharted waters of moneymaking using magic.  
As 
&gt; for the &quot;making gold thing&quot;, I would give up on that. There are 
only 
&gt; a few, real McCoy, Alchemist, remaining on our world and they 
refuse 
&gt; to let themselves be known. It would be nice if someone out there 
who 
&gt; would be brave enough to write a simplified version of magical 
&gt; steps/attainments, thus cutting away all the areas of &quot;enigmas&quot; 
which 
&gt; has stalled many of us on the path of our magical evolution. It's 
&gt; just like the age of the typewriter vs. the computer; are we 
willing 
&gt; to make that change?

&gt; &gt; Just as long as I achieve basic results I can know that the 
whole 
&gt; &gt; thing is real and it's just a matter of time to reach the other 
&gt; &gt; abilities. That's basically all I need to get to.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What have you been able to achieve and how did you do it, and 
also 
&gt; &gt; how long did it take?

this

&gt; &gt; &gt; It may take a lifetime of many lifetimes to achieve what one

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Ardesir,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have dealt with Bardon's System for the past 16 years -
 
&gt; &gt; &gt; with &quot;some&quot; success. Some of the techniques I found to be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; attainable. What in specific do you want to know? For 
&gt; &gt; example: Can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; one change one life's situation for the better? Can it get 
one 
&gt; &gt; out 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of debt? Can it make one safe? Can it make one more 
&gt; &gt; intelligent?  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can it make one immortal? I guess what I am trying to find 
out 
&gt; &gt; from 
&gt; &gt; &gt; you first is what do you want to attain because a lot of 
&gt; &gt; individuals 
&gt; &gt; &gt; approach the Bardon's System expecting to have the world at 
&gt; &gt; their 
&gt; &gt; &gt; command. Let me know, and I will respond.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
