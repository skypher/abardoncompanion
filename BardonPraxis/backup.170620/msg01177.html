Sorry. Re-read your post. You say that your son and realised that 
your son has no attack. 

I wonder from which point doctors did diagnostize a temporal lobe 
epilepsie. We have all potentially a lot of illness, and do not 
necessarely developp them. 

It is no good to take medication to cure something which has not 
actually take place. Just create the problem. 
Right attitude is to try to balance the energetic and psychologis 
imbalance from which the potential illness originates.

Aren't doctors are thristy for power and control over you life when 
pretending to identify illness in advance with no actual signs ? It 
is like parents given drugs to babies because they find them too 
active.

May be your son just miss his mother and his being angry is just a 
means to affirm himself ?

regards,

Pierre Mikael

&gt; Hi There,
&gt; 
&gt; Before asking my question let me first explain what the problem is.
&gt; 
&gt; My son Caelan is 3 years old and he causing me great concern.
&gt; 18 months ago he was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy.
&gt; He has never had a attack but the doctor assured me that he needs 
medication
&gt; urgently
&gt; as he would get worse soon. He was put on a drug called tegretol. 
Things got
&gt; worse.
&gt; As I manufacture herbal tinctures I took him off the tegretol and 
am giving
&gt; him a special
&gt; epilepsy tincture that I mix for him. This is helping but not as 
much as I
&gt; have hoped.
&gt; I am divorced and he lives with me. The thing is that he has 
aggressive
&gt; spells. Cries easily.
&gt; Wakes up crying. Never listens. He has the strongest will I have 
ever seen.
&gt; I envy him for that.
&gt; Besides that he is very intelligent and ahead in development for 
his age.
&gt; Besides that he has brainwaves that are &quot;different&quot; I believe the 
problem
&gt; might be more psycological.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is this: How can I use what I am doing in IIH to be of 
help to
&gt; him?
&gt; I am about to start with step 2.
&gt; I know that later in my work I could do a lot more.
&gt; If I am not advanced enough then could someone advanced not create a
&gt; elemental to help him?
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody with any thoughts or suggestions?
&gt; Many thanks in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards
&gt; 
&gt; Johan Pretorius
