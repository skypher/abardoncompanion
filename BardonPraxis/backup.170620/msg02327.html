<pre>Greetings.

My name is Decio, I am 28 yo from Brazil, and I just came about the 
possibility of finding a discussion group of Bardon's teachings.

I've read IIH and I just thought it a great working book. Perhaps I 
should better state that I've only read the thorical part of the 
book, since I feel that I am still not ready to compromise myself as 
much as I should to the practical exercises (I work all day and study 
during night time, having only 5 hours of sleep available).

Well my question is one based on not many sources I've found about 
Bardon and his work. Everything I've seen and read that was available 
to me concerning magical works, hermetics, occultists and occult 
schools and the people we normally hear of associated to those topics 
never mentioned anyone like Fraz Bardon, or the kind of work I've 
seen in his books. Perhaps that is because I have no real contact to 
the 'germanian' occultists, but no one seems to mention his work.

Also, I've participated in the O.T.O. discussion group from Brazil, 
and some of the Golden Dawn ones, and not anyone I asked mentioned 
Bardon's works.

So I am curious to know why is that so. Is his kind of work, and self-
development, all that different from what those occult schools 
teach? Or does it happen more because of ego (something 
like 'GD', 'OTO' and all those are the elite and nothing else matters 
kind of thing)?
What *are* the differences in approuch between them? Or is it 
something I am supposed to discover as well by my own development?

I think we all know that the true meaning and effects of all those 
rituals, concepts and exercises from the old era are pretty much lost 
today, as seems to indicate by the kind of training we found in the 
original G.D. (or at least, as my minimal knowledge of it can present 
me). And I am not looking for the &quot;who's the best&quot; kind of thing, but 
how can Bardon's teachings work on ourselves, and what does it lacks 
compared to any other kind of hermetic or occult study?

I know this may actually be a simple question, answered quickly as I 
follow my own path, but if you could show your inputs, I would very 
much appreciate it.


Light and Peace to all.
D&#xE9;cio
