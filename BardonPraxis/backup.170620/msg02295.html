<pre>I have a copy of this book, and I found that the author approaches the
Occult from a different angle than IIH. There seems to be a lot of
&quot;don't do this, don't do that!&quot; and I found that he was instilling a
sense of fear about the Art of Magic, so I gave his book a rest.
Aside from which, I don't understand why he writes that Pranayama is
ESSENTIAL to open the Chakras.
Have a nice holiday Rawn.
All the best,
C

&gt; Dear Daniel,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I was wondering if anyone from this group has read this book, and has
&gt; insights to share about it - ever since I got Bardon's books I am rather
&gt; reluctant when it comes to purchasing other occult books, as they may
&gt; stray me from my path, but this book intrigues me as it is supposed to
&gt; be tailored especially for one learning from Bardon's work. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; I've read everything available about this book on the &quot;Hidden Gate&quot;
&gt; website and just today purchased the downloadable version. During my
&gt; holiday, I will read the book and comment more thoroughly, come April.
&gt; :) Nonetheless, judging from what's available on &quot;Hidden Gate&quot;, I can
&gt; say that the author is obviously sincere.
&gt; 
&gt; I do however, disagree in principle with the author's assertion that
&gt; several months of additional exercises are necessary *before* beginning
&gt; Step One of IIH. He seems to base this assumption on the idea that 90%
&gt; of folks who pick up IIH, put it down after about three years. His
&gt; response to that seems to be these additional exercises. My own opinion
&gt; is that it's not a matter of needing preparatory exercises; but rather,
&gt; one of correctly understanding the exercises of Step One. In other
&gt; words, the &quot;problem&quot; is conceptual. That has certainly been affirmed by
&gt; my own experience in my years of participating in discussion groups.
&gt; 
&gt; But as I said, the author shows all the hallmarks of sincerity and
&gt; actual experience. Furthermore, he claims that the regimen he
&gt; prescribes has worked for those who did experience difficulty (although
&gt; it is hard to determine whether his own personal guidance had this
&gt; affect or if it was indeed his regimen of additional exercises).
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
