Hi, yes it does help. From you said it's clear to me that you 
understood the problem as I was describing it and so gave a reply or 
answer that was helpful. I actually just had a image thought that I 
didn't consciously intentionally will. The other problem that I 
have with this excercise is not getting involved in the stream of 
thoughts and cutting them off or stopping them. Do you have any 
suggestions on that? Thanks again.

&gt; 
&gt; Not all thoughts are provoked by our will. Maybe a memory 
will 
&gt; arise unbidden, unasked for. Maybe a good one, maybe a bad one. Or 
&gt; you associate one thing with another, thoughts comeing forth, one 
&gt; after another. Most peoples entire days are filled with nothing 
but 
&gt; this, a circle of thoughts, one thought, shaping from one thing to 
&gt; another.
&gt; 
&gt; Watch your mind, any sound, any idea, any music stuck in your 
&gt; head, even the thought, the idea &quot;im watching my mind&quot;. Your a 
part 
&gt; of it all, but how much of that stuff did you Will into your mind? 
&gt; You have to relax your will and the grip/control you think you 
have 
&gt; of your mind. Try to dispell those things, all of them, and exist 
&gt; purely as one with the things around you, in the moment, or even 
one 
&gt; of them. Try just for a few moments, and youll see that you dont 
have 
&gt; has much of a grip/active role in your mind and thoughts as one 
would 
&gt; think. The song comes back, the imagery keeps going, the thoughts 
&gt; keep changing thier shape.
&gt; 
&gt; One you can see how you have less control than you think, the 
&gt; first step to control is the first step itself, which is to watch 
&gt; these thoughts. Dont tell them to do anything, dont stop them if 
they 
&gt; become unpleasant or boring, because those things in itself will 
&gt; bring more thoughts. The mind responds to emotional stimuli, and 
vice-
&gt; versa. In other words, you dont have to will anything because it 
will 
&gt; just happen, because already your thoughts have a 'will' of thier 
own 
&gt; until you get further in the exercizes and can begin to shape them 
&gt; and move them with your will.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt; But if anyone can give me a specific clarification of my problem 
&gt; &gt; with the first excercise I would appreciate it. My problem is 
that 
&gt; &gt; I don't see how we can have a train of thought without being 
&gt; &gt; actively involved in imagining it, so then I don't understand 
how 
&gt; we 
&gt; &gt; can be detached from a train of thought when a train of thought 
&gt; &gt; requires active participation in imagining it. Thanks for your 
&gt; help.
