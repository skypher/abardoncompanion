<pre>Rawn, 

I think I am struggling with the verification process. I do 
meditate a lot and a lot of it I feel completely dumbfounded when 
trying to rationalize the experience. I just accept it as something 
that has happened as an experience, but I have also come to a point 
where I Try not to believe in anything (not nihilism, but to not have 
any preconceptions of it that could bias me; another way of 
saying &quot;im trying to be as present-minded as possible&quot;. Not 
believing in anything is still believing in Nihilism, this is what I 
am staying away from.) The problem that I encounter is going by 
feeling when I have an insight... &quot;Is this true or not.&quot; All I can 
do is go by what *FEELS* correct. In your Experience, will the 
feeling be correct just by consistancy? or will the feeling just be 
so strong that there is no denying it, like faith? I guess I am 
trying to figure out how to verify feelings because experience seems 
to have more feelings. Your previous response seems to have a great 
deal of emphasis on a proper form of rational Faith. I have a 
feeling that your response will be somewhere close to &quot;just keep on 
trucking&quot;

LOL its my epistemological hell (j/k)

I don't suffer from it actually, Im amazed by the beauty of the whole 
of creation but I am becomming more and more mystified by trying to 
figure it out. I look at the outside world and it doesnt seem real 
to me either because of the other realities or depersonalization... 
or both LOL. Ultimately, I would like to hit the bottom of the Rabbit 
hole and, God Willing, I will be fortunate to have a shovel to dig a 
little more.

Possibly good that I want to dissect the details. It's just going to 
take a little longer to reach the goal because of it. :-)


Thanks again Rawn for listening to my ramblings

~Louis

&gt; Dear Louis,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have this strange aversion to meditating on anything because I 
am
&gt; afraid that I will convince myself that something is true through 
the
&gt; faculties of the mind; deluding myself actually. I like the 
conjecture
&gt; because it helps me look at things through different angles. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Well, conjecture (i.e., thinking about something from as many 
angles as
&gt; you can) *is* a very valid form of &quot;meditation&quot;. :)
&gt; 
&gt; At some point however, you will have to confront and make peace with
&gt; this fear you that associate with deeper forms of meditation: i.e.,
&gt; meditations that involve directly opening yourself to non-rational 
or
&gt; non-intellectual sources of insight. One way to do this is to 
approach
&gt; such insights very critically, question them exhaustively and do not
&gt; accept them as *fact* or valid *until* you have verified them. 
Through
&gt; that process you will come to know *experientially* which insights 
you
&gt; *can* trust and this will build your trust in the process itself.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I just read the short glib that bardon has in IIH
&gt; about Akasha at the begining. Getting away from the
&gt; something and nothing going into the bag. I Just got
&gt; a mental idea that you cannot quantify something that
&gt; is incomprehensable. Accumulation is to quantify in
&gt; some regard.
&gt; If this is true, then how does it fit into
&gt; &quot;...Inhaling the akasha...filling the whole body with
&gt; it.&quot; &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; What you are inhaling and filling the body with is the *feeling* of
&gt; &quot;being united to the entire infinite space&quot;, along with an
&gt; &quot;ultra-violet, near black-violet colour&quot;. In effect, you are 
merging
&gt; your body and your conscious awareness *with* the Akasha, *through* 
the
&gt; inhalation of its primary qualities.
&gt; 
&gt; Once united with the Akasha in this way, you will immediately 
understand
&gt; why the Akasha cannot be dynamically accumulated. To dynamically
&gt; accumulate something means that you are confining it, penning in the
&gt; explosive pressure of its dense power. But the Akasha penetrates
&gt; *everything* -- how then, can you confine it?
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
