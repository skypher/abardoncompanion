<tt>No. He is not. Even though we must try to ascertain our *own* truth.. it is 
ever a short stopping place to reflect and gather and then move on agian. We 
are certainly not in the &quot;place&quot; to judge ourselves correctly nor completely 
nor even truthfully. We are always operating from our own limited and 
blinded &quot;toolset&quot;. Consequently, we cannot be our own &quot;gods&quot; with any real 
faith in our own understanding. We must try though, and we must fail. We 
must seek a higher relationship again and agian to aide us in our HUMBLED 
approach at Knowing ourselves as G-d knows us. WE learn to truely love 
ourselves with humbleness and joy in the process, as G-d loves us... we 
begin to COMPREHEND it instead of rationally understand it. It becomes what 
we are instead of what we understand or what we practice.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>&quot;...Rely not upon your own understanding..&quot; was good advise and wise 
council.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Consider we would have such a limited sphere of activity if we were truely a 
&quot;closed system&quot; w/o need of a relationship to the greater portions of 
ourselves and God.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I suppose the KEY to everyting is not self understanding, it is instead, 
&quot;relationship&quot;.</tt><br>

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Dear Rawn,</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Thank you for the prompt response.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Just to fully understand the meaning of your words, I would like to
bring an hypothetical example of some one who did a very sincere,
thorough examination of his self. He followed his inner truth,
listened to his inner voice. The results were quite good, and he
came up with over 200 bad traits which he then carefully assigned to
every element. There was only one problem, he did not fully
appreciate the negative impact that his vengfulness had on him and
failed to include the trait in his &quot;Black&quot; Soul Mirror. This should
not surprise us, as he was still in the very beginning of his
spiritual path, and his senses were sometimes deceptive.
With years of intensive work he managed to transform his negative
traits in the mirror into positive ones. From his point of view, he
became a very good human being, only that he still was quite
vengeful, and anybody around him could testify this...</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Now my question is, is he a balanced human being, only because from
his point of view he is? If all that matters is our own truth
and &quot;Subjective vs. objective has no meaning here&quot;, this would imply
that yes, because this is exactly what HIS Inner Voice tells him. Or
am I wrong?</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Also, do you think that I am complicating things too much here?</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Thanks,
David</pre><br>

&gt; Dear David,
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; BUT since I am far from perfection, since my
&gt; senses are not fully developed and since I have very little
&gt; experience in life, I consider analysing and contemplating upon the
&gt; ideas of other people - who might raise points that I have not
&gt; thought about - as an integral part of my evaluation process. The
&gt; way I see it (and please correct me if you disagree), evaluation is
&gt; when I gather all the possible and available information from all
&gt; possible sources (including mine, my parents', the milkman's and
the
&gt; taxi drivers'), and then make MY OWN conclusion about it. &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Ordinarily, that's a fine sentiment but with the Mirror work, it's
&gt; inappropriate because this is not an intellectual process. The
&gt; evaluations of the Soul Mirror are instinctual and based upon an
inner
&gt; knowing, not upon a thinking, weighing, etc. You *know* if a
thing is
&gt; right or wrong for you, positive or negative. The Soul Mirror
requires
&gt; this level of introspection (*inner*-examination) instead of just
an
&gt; intellectualization.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Since my senses are not fully developed, since my ability to
judge
&gt; is limited, I am very likely to come to a very personal conclusion
&gt; about money, career or indeed any other topic, which from my own
&gt; perspective will be absolutely true and sincere (plus will have the
&gt; affirmation of my &quot;inner voice&quot;), but yet will be the total
opposite
&gt; of the objective truth. &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; All that matters with the Soul Mirror is *your* truth. Not what
any one
&gt; else thinks. *Your* truth. Subjective vs. objective has no
meaning
&gt; here.
&gt;
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
