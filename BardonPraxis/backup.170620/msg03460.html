I asked myself the same question a week or so ago. I recently 
got into smoking Tabacoo out of a hookah and all the various flavors 
thereof, even though ive never smoked cigarettes. My mentor said 
something to me which clicked with the teachings of Bardon. He 
pointed out how the hookah represents the four elements. The tabacco 
is earth, the charcoal is fire, the water for a filter is of course 
water, and one uses air to operate it.

I was considering Bardons impregnation exercizes, and decided it 
would be possible using a hookah (and therefore using any form of 
smoking tabacco in theory) in the same ways as food and drink.

The tabacco would be my desire. The charcoal would represent my 
will. I will know when lighting the charcoal that the moment the 
tabacco begins to burn, my desire is being realized. I would use the 
water as a purification of my desire. I will know that the water will 
seperate the &quot;dross from the gold&quot; so to speak, so only the purest 
form of my desire will come forth, and wont be debased through 
selfishness. I can attach the act of inhaling the tabacco to 
strengthening some aspect of myself which may have been hindering me 
from previously realizing my desire. Perhaps my desire is to do 
better financially at my job. Then i can inhale the idea of being a 
better worker, perhaps finding some flaw in my work ethics, and 
exhale its opposite.

This utilizes a few different forms of his impregnation and pore-
breathing exercizes, but the same idea could be applied to 
cigarettes. You still have Tabacco-Earth, Fire-Fire, Filter-Water, 
Breath-Air. Far simpler still you could just impregnate the cigarette 
with your desire, and as it burns know its being realized. But the 
Akashic principle can impregnate anything at all so im sure theres 
many ways it could be used with cigarettes.

&gt; I know that this is strange question but I have smoked for more 
than 30 years and Rawn Clark smokes also Franz Bardon smoked all his 
life. As far as reading the posted messages I have never read 
something concerning this topic. The question is if it is possible 
using the akasha principle to impregnate our desires into tobacco. I 
believe it is possible. I also believe that there is nothing wrong 
with smoking and it very simple enjoyable pleasure.
