<pre>Dear Kiyan,

Welcome to BardonPraxis. :) Sorry it took so long for me to get your
intro onto the list but I was away this past weekend and didn't return
until this afternoon.

My best to you,

Subject: Introducing ... before questions


Hello, my name is Kiyan, and I have recently developed
a serious interest in the book &quot;Initiation into
Hermetics.&quot;

When I was very young, I had an interest in
witchcraft. My mother introduced me to many
psychological methods based on est and NLP. These
were helpful tools, but, of course, lacked a spiritual
foundation. Like many occultists, I came across books
by chance, almost as if they &quot;fell into my lap.&quot;

&gt;From very basic witchcraft I shifted to an intense
focus on Crowley. I was fascinated by his intellect
and personality. I've read his autohagiography twice,
and own many of his cornerstone works. Still, his
system is very confusing, and while I use much of his
writing (for instance the Book of Thoth for
interpreting the paths) I find most of his writing
requires too much cross-referencing. Also, I think
his ego gets in the way too often. I still value his
works, however.

Recently I have been studying the Qabalah and working
upon the tree. I plan to continue my quabalistic
studies while I work upon Bardon's initiation
methodology.

I suppose I should mention that I sustain a personal
magic system that is entirely unique, retained since
early childhood. In fact it so unique that there is
no purpose in saying anything else about it. I guess
I want people out there to know it's ok to have their
own magical creations.

I am drawn to Bardon mostly because of a sense of his
earnestness and purity of heart. I hope to fulfill
initiation so I may &quot;love under will&quot; to the utmost of
my power.

Over the next few days I will have many questions and
I hope to use this group to sort through these. If
some may find these questions naive, then so be it. I
still intend to ask these questions. I have searched
the message archives but not found the answers. I
know someone out there can help me.

Well, I have said enough. Fist of Mars is my moniker
because recently I have felt a need to draw upon the
force of Geburah.

Talk to you soon,

Kiyan

Hello,

Thank you for joining the &quot;Bardon Praxis&quot; group! :)

This is a moderated group specifically for those who
are actively pursuing the work of Franz Bardon's
&quot;Initiation Into Hermetics&quot;, &quot;The Practice of Magical
Evocation&quot; and/or &quot;The Key to the True Quabbalah&quot;.
Discussion will be limited to practical and
theoretical issues *directly* related the pursuit of
Bardon's system of initiation.

Since this is a moderated group, I will examine all
submissions for relevance before they are posted to
the website and to the rest of the membership. My
moderation of posts will adhere to two *absolute*
rules: #1) All posts *must* be clearly relevant to the
Bardon work. #2)Absolutely *no* rude or disrespectful
posts will be allowed.

This doesn't mean that I will limit Bardon-related
discussion, nor that I will be micro-managing
interpersonal relations amongst the membership. ;-) I
simply wish to create a focused discussion group,
within parameters that will guarantee focus instead of
distraction.

All members may post whatever they want to the
&quot;Files&quot;, Photos&quot;, Links&quot;, &quot;Polls&quot; and &quot;Calendar&quot;
sections of the BardonPraxis homepage, so long as it
pertains to the Bardon work. Links to these sections
can be found at the left-hand side of the BardonPraxis
homepage. <a  href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BardonPraxis/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BardonPraxis/</a>

If you feel so inclined, please reply to this email
with a brief introduction of yourself and I will
forward it to the entire list.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
