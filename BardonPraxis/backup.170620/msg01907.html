<pre>Dear Mark ~

I think I see here an example of the fallacious thinking &quot;It is 
nothing but...&quot;.

Only created things follow absolute laws, and guess what: Creation is 
from a finite perspective impossible! Why? Just go &quot;back&quot; and try to 
find the Ultimate Creator. Ultimately, you cannot, because that would 
imply something which itself must have been created. So basically 
reality cannot really exist from any &quot;sane&quot; perspective.

The problem is what Rawn calls &quot;sequential awareness&quot;; the idea of 
dimensional extension being a cause rather than the effect of 
creation. The sequential mind simply cannot grasp the Real of 
Reality, but must abstract it into finite concepts. It is easy to 
throw around words like &quot;eternity&quot; and &quot;infinity&quot;, but it is 
literally impossible to grasp onto what these words mean. If you 
tried finding the source of creation as I adviced, and came to 
that &quot;Whoaw&quot; were a glimpse of this absurdity was realized, you will 
know what I mean. It is like a big &quot;DON'T GO THERE&quot; and a reminder of 
how little mankind really knows. The point is that there is 
absolutely NOTHING logical about reality whatsoever, because 
logically it simply can not exist.

The confines, therefore, are all in your sequential mind. Good 
things, too, because absolute chaos could be just around the corner; 
poetically it _is_ just around the corner you fortunately 
seldom/never reach.

A paradox: You can know the essential meaning of a tree in an 
instant, but spend eternity studying it and never find it.

The &quot;tree&quot; is arbitrary. There will always be another box within the 
box newly opened.


Well met

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been meditating on something heavily recently and have come up 
against somethgin of a stumbling block. Part of ascendence is the 
recognition that (particularly in relation to the Qaballah) that the 
universe is infinitely complex and the Briatic contains this infinte 
amount of possibilities.
&gt; 
&gt; My stumbling point is, that everything is still subject to absolue 
laws and some relate to what is *feasible*. Given these laws are 
absolute and fixed and within the physical world, there is a tangible 
(if almost infinitely massive) amount of space in which things 
attached to said universal laws can happen. Regardless of how 
phenomenally massive the amount of possibilities is, does this not 
also equate to ultimately there being a tangible integer less than 
infinity of all the possibilities that can genuinely happen given 
there is a fixed set of these laws, if not in the astral and mental 
realms; certainly within the physical world. If this is the case, 
then at some point there must be an equivalent state within the other 
realms as they are all necessarily connected up to the one.
&gt; 
&gt; This would, to my mind, be equal to the confines of *possibility* 
that define an entire &quot;universe&quot;. Does this also mean that the 
modifications to the relevant universal laws in each complete 
universe determines the absolute size of the overall possibilities 
that I am talking about. Hope that makes sense ;-) 
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark
