Dear Rawn and all

I have some confusion, not being clear about a certain subject 
concerning intro./character-building of step 1 / 2 of IIH.

Although, as you say Rawn, the inner voice is most important for 
classifying what is negative or positive, there are still (as you 
have said too) some external results (concerning whether a step is 
mastered or not) ? and sometimes, someone may feel negative about 
certain traits and that feeling itself (as he may recognise later) is 
the problem and not the trait (or the other way round, too). So a 
kind of *general* approach could be helpful especially concerning 
larvae or schemes because Bardon himself points them as a (rather 
negative) general category to be mastered in order to get a noble 
character.

(and, if it were true, that just the inner voice as it arise within 
every individual to be the *only* criterion for what is noble or not, 
then a criminal or so called black magician hurting others could be 
called very noble just provided they feel good about themselves). 

So, shortly asked, does developing a noble character in terms of 
Bardon 
rather mean mastering and balancing your soul or also or rather mean 
purifying / cleansing + transforming your soul concerning negative 
traits (or what the individual feels for themselves to be negative)?

Lets say that *every* thought form, every feeling, may it be noble or 
not, could be generally named as *elemental* (definition by Daskalos) 
(elementals not meant as Nature Spirit here). So, larvae are 
elementals as well as any kind of positive thought form like a divine 
symbol, even a cabbalistic letter according to *thise* definition.

Now, for example, take: The book &quot;Pranic Psychic Self
Defense&quot; by 
Choa Kok Sui, (at least that German translation I have), there are 
some nice pictures of some kinds of elementals or larvae. For example 
an elemental of learning, very clear shining. An elemental of fear, 
like a dark heavy grey-black blue dusty cloud. A beautiful elemental 
of heart-love, like a subtle symmetric spiral form ? very lovely
and soft. And also an elemental of sexual passion, more heavy, orange 
and dark red colored, less symmetric form and less lovely. Then, 
there are some non-colored pictures: A smoking larvae, living at the 
chest area of smokers. They look quite mean, like an intelligent 
little grey cloud, wanting the smoker to smoke again and again.
(For Pranic healing people therefore, smoking out of pleasure would 
still be caused not by your higher will but by those larvae - *they* 
long for a kind of purity).

Now, Bardon himself sometimes speaks of *control* (or *master*). 
Other times, he speaks of *cleansing* your soul, make it *pure* or 
*get rid of* (German: &quot;beseitigen&quot;) passions. This is
confusing a bit.

*** So, what does *noble* mean, especially concerning passions? ***

Those it just mean to *master* those (not so nice looking) larvae 
like sexual passions or smoking larvae in terms of *control* them by 
your will, so it is your will deciding *when* to smoke or having 
sexual pleasure and when not, as a kind of time-regulation how often?
Or does it rather mean *transforming* those not so nice looking 
larvae or elementals into more beautiful looking ones, so one has 
then *beautiful-noble* sexual passion larvae instead of heavy dark 
one? 
Or does it mean for those having successfully mastered step 2, having 
(for example) removed or transformed more or less *all * larvae and 
now just to smoke or enjoy sex out of higher noble beautiful 
mental/astral elementals like lovely looking ones?

And last question, how can I be sure, concerning sexuality, that need 
for sex is caused by *noble* elementals and not by eros-schemen? And 
are those eros-schemes (Eros-Schemen) (compared with larvae) just to 
be removed or to be transformed?
How is it possible to recognise and differ those kinds of elementals, 
larvae or eros-schemes for beginners step 1 / 2 that are not 
clairvoyant?

With best regards
Patrik
