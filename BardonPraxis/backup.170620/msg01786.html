<pre>Hi

*Mindfulness in Plain English*

I made the research through Google. Found the pdf,
added its URL to Praxis' links.
Cheers

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; This book has quite a few applicable techniques. I
&gt; used some of the techniques for distractions to
&gt; deepen
&gt; my meditation exercises. The entire book is actually
&gt; legally available in .PDF format. If you can't find
&gt; it, I will post a link.
&gt; 
&gt; Another useful and free book on the Internet is
&gt; called
&gt; &quot;The Power of Concentration&quot;. Many of the exercises
&gt; in
&gt; this book are extremely similar to exercises in IIH.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not on my usual laptop and therefore I will need
&gt; to wait until tomorrow to post the links. A search
&gt; on
&gt; Google should find them though.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Allen Kray

&gt; &gt; I found an interesting article on a Vipassana
&gt; &gt; website contrasting 
&gt; &gt; mindfulness and concentration. Seems to be quite
&gt; &gt; relevant, so I 
&gt; &gt; thought I'd share. The full article, actually
&gt; part
&gt; &gt; of the book 
&gt; &gt; Mindfulness in Plain English, is at 
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; David
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt; &gt; Concentration and mindfulness go hand-in-hand in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; job of 
&gt; &gt; meditation. Mindfulness directs the power of
&gt; &gt; concentration. 
&gt; &gt; Mindfulness is the manager of the operation.
&gt; &gt; Concentration furnishes 
&gt; &gt; the power by which mindfulness can penetrate into
&gt; &gt; the deepest level 
&gt; &gt; of the mind. Their cooperation results in insight
&gt; &gt; and understanding. 
&gt; &gt; These must be cultivated together in a balanced
&gt; &gt; ratio. Just a bit 
&gt; &gt; more emphasis is given to mindfulness because
&gt; &gt; mindfulness is the 
&gt; &gt; center of meditation. The deepest levels of
&gt; &gt; concentration are not 
&gt; &gt; really needed to do the job of liberation. Still,
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; balance is 
&gt; &gt; essential. Too much awareness without calm to
&gt; &gt; balance it will result 
&gt; &gt; in a wildly over sensitized state similar to
&gt; abusing
&gt; &gt; LSD. Too much 
&gt; &gt; concentration without a balancing ratio of
&gt; awareness
&gt; &gt; will result in 
&gt; &gt; the 'Stone Buddha' syndrome. The meditator gets so
&gt; &gt; tranquilized that 
&gt; &gt; he sits there like a rock. Both of these are to be
&gt; &gt; avoided.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The initial stages of mental cultivation are
&gt; &gt; especially delicate. Too 
&gt; &gt; much emphasis on mindfulness at this point will
&gt; &gt; actually retard the 
&gt; &gt; development of concentration. When getting started
&gt; &gt; in meditation, one 
&gt; &gt; of the first things you will notice is how
&gt; &gt; incredibly active the mind 
&gt; &gt; really is. The Theravada tradition calls this
&gt; &gt; phenomenon 'monkey 
&gt; &gt; mind'. The Tibetan tradition likens it to a
&gt; &gt; waterfall of thought. If 
&gt; &gt; you emphasize the awareness function at this
&gt; point,
&gt; &gt; there will be so 
&gt; &gt; much to be aware of that concentration will be
&gt; &gt; impossible. Don't get 
&gt; &gt; discouraged. This happens to everybody. And there
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; a simple 
&gt; &gt; solution. Put most of your effort into
&gt; &gt; one-pointedness at the 
&gt; &gt; beginning. Just keep calling the attention from
&gt; &gt; wandering over and 
&gt; &gt; over again. Tough it out. Full instructions on how
&gt; &gt; to do this are in 
&gt; &gt; Chapters 7 and 8. A couple of months down the
&gt; track
&gt; &gt; and you will have 
&gt; &gt; developed concentration power. Then you can start
&gt; &gt; pumping you energy 
&gt; &gt; into mindfulness. Do not, however, go so far with
&gt; &gt; concentration that 
&gt; &gt; you find yourself going into a stupor.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mindfulness still is the more important of the two
&gt; &gt; components. It 
&gt; &gt; should be built as soon as you comfortably can do
&gt; &gt; so. Mindfulness 
&gt; &gt; provides the needed foundation for the subsequent
&gt; &gt; development of 
&gt; &gt; deeper concentration. Most blunders in this area
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; balance will 
&gt; &gt; correct themselves in time. Right concentration
&gt; &gt; develops naturally in 
&gt; &gt; the wake of strong mindfulness. The more you
&gt; develop
&gt; &gt; the noticing 
&gt; &gt; factor, the quicker you will notice the
&gt; distraction
&gt; &gt; and the quicker 
&gt; &gt; you will pull out of it and return to the formal
&gt; &gt; object of attention. 
&gt; &gt; The natural result is increased concentration. And
&gt; &gt; as concentration 
&gt; &gt; develops, it assists the development of
&gt; mindfulness.
&gt; &gt; The more 
&gt; &gt; concentration power you have, the less chance
&gt; there
&gt; &gt; is of launching 
&gt; &gt; off on a long chain of analysis about the
&gt; &gt; distraction. You simply 
&gt; &gt; note the distraction and return your attention to
&gt; &gt; where it is 
&gt; &gt; supposed to be.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thus the two factors tend to balance and support
&gt; &gt; each other's growth 
&gt; &gt; quite naturally. Just about the only rule you need
&gt; &gt; to follow at this 
&gt; &gt; point is to put your effort on concentration at
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; beginning, until 
&gt; &gt; the monkey mind phenomenon has cooled down a bit.
&gt; &gt; After that, 
&gt; &gt; emphasize mindfulness. If you find yourself
&gt; getting
&gt; &gt; frantic, 
&gt; &gt; emphasize concentration. If you find yourself
&gt; going
&gt; &gt; into a stupor, 
&gt; &gt; emphasize mindfulness. Overall, mindfulness is the
&gt; &gt; on to emphasize.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mindfulness guides your development in meditation
&gt; &gt; because mindfulness 
&gt; &gt; has the ability to be aware of itself. it is
&gt; &gt; mindfulness which will 
&gt; &gt; give you a perspective on your practice.
&gt; Mindfulness
&gt; &gt; will let you 
&gt; &gt; know how you are doing. But don't worry too much
&gt; &gt; about that. This is 
&gt; &gt; not a race. You are not in competition with
&gt; anybody,
&gt; &gt; and there is no 
&gt; &gt; schedule.
