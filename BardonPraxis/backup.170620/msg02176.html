<pre>Hi,

I haven't done my astral mirrors yet, aside from keeping a diary and noting how 
often I used words that were related to the different elements. On the other 
hand, I'm pretty familiar with modern Western astrology. 

If I were to use my natal chart determine if there was a preponderance of one 
element, for example, first I'd look at the elements of the signs occupied by 
the Sun, Moon, and Ascendant. I'd count those elements twice. Then I'd look at 
the signs occupied by Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. I'd count those 
once each.

Planets are also of the nature of an element, in some cases mixed. The Sun 
rules a fire sign, Leo, for example, so if you were born with the Sun rising or 
on the midheaven it gives you more fire regardless of the sign it's in, and 
even more than that if it is in a fire sign as well. So look at the planets 
that are rising or at the midheaven, if any, and take their basic nature into 
account as well. The Moon is watery, Mercury Venus and Saturn are earthy and 
airy, Mars and Jupiter are watery and firey. Look also at the planets on the 
other angles, which are the descendant and the nadir. I consider Saturn the 
most earthy of the planets and Mercury the most airy, the Sun the most firey, 
and the Moon the most watery.

The outer planets can also affect your disposition. If you have Neptune conjuct 
the Sun, Moon or Ascendant it gives more water, but in an odd transpersonal 
way. The outer planets are the most difficult to consciously moderate. If 
anyone has ideas about how to work with their energy in terms of balancing the 
personality I'd be interested. At the time Bardon was writing Uranus, Neptune 
and Pluto were little-used in astrology and less if at all in magic, which is 
interesting because according to modern thought the prominence of these planets 
natally is supposed to incline one to an interest in these arts.

According to many moderns, Uranus is associated with astrology and liberation 
from social and childhood conditioning, Neptune with magic, psychic ability and 
hypnosis, Pluto with mind control, psychology and forms of non-physical 
domination, including of one's own nature and behavior. I don't know how to use 
this information in Bardonian terms, but I wouldn't ignore their natal 
condition completely.

Thanks
