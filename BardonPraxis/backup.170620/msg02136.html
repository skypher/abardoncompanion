aspects among natal planets.).

The interpretations of astrological factors given in most of these
textbooks are generally accurate, especially the interpretations of
natal, synastric comparison, and transiting/ progressed aspects by F.
Sakoian and L.S. Acker. However, the tendency has been for some
published astrologers in recent decades to introduce many additional
astrological factors into the interpretation of horoscopes, e.g. Arabian
parts, asteroids, hypothetical trans-Plutonian planets, many fixed
stars, comets, mid-points and aspects to them, nodes of planets' orbits,
vertices, many minor aspects, etc., as fudges without any real
scientific reasons or objective research whatsoever. Reinhold Ebertin's
Hamburg, Germany, &quot;School of Cosmobiology&quot; has been a major offender in
this respect. Sometimes this sort of thing has been done, probably by
astrologers with badly afflicted Neptunes, under the guise of nebulously
&quot;adding a spiritual dimension to astrology&quot;!. If taken seriously, such
spurious or irrelevant additional factors would result in horoscope
interpretation becoming impossibly complicated and incorrect.
Unfortunately, the gross errors so introduced have become propagated
through plagiarism by successive uncritical authors. This sort of thing
has led to astrology acquiring a bad reputation amongst the scientific
establishment.

To prevent such errors, the principle of &quot;Ockham's razor&quot;, also called
the law of economy or parsimony or least action, attributed to the
English philosopher William of Ockham or Occam (1285 -1349), that 
the fewest possible assumptions should be made in explaining
something, should be rigorously applied to astrology, particularly
research. Ockham's original theorem, in his Latin Scriptum in
Librum Primum Sententiarum, Opera Theologica, I, p.74, was &quot;non sunt
multiplicanda entia praeter necessitatem&quot; = &quot;[hypothetical] entities are
not to be multiplied beyond necessity&quot;, as applied originally to the
logical analysis of theological dogma. This principle is central to the
philosophy of science, and was used by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in
defending the simplest hypothesis of the heavens. More recently
(19th-20th centuries), the Austrian physicist- philosopher Ernst Mach
enunciated it as requiring sciences to explain nature in the simplest
and most economical conceptual formulations; and British mathematician
-philosopher Bertrand Russell found it to be a very fruitful principle
in logical analysis. It thus works hand-in-hand with scientific
objectivity, and reproducibility of reported research results.

However, this does not preclude a policy of &quot;all things considered&quot;:
reasonable propositions in astrology (as in other sciences) supported by
evidence and/or logic, or at least not ruled out by evidence and/or
logic, should be objectively analyzed. See, for example, An Introduction
to Philosophical Analysis by John Hospers (1956), p.287, 363; and the
Encyclopaedia Britannica articles on Ockham /Occam and his principle.
Astrologers would do well to read up on the philosophy of science.

&gt;
