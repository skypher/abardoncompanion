<pre>Dear Ravi,

&gt;&gt; ok . fair enough :-) I *thought* I was on topic :-) &lt;&lt;

:) You were and are on topic. That's not the issue I was raising. My
point is that this begs to be related to your actual experience . . .
which you have now done. :)

&gt;&gt; I guess this does reflect my experience in a way . But that is a
long story . Suffice to say that when i created my mirror with &quot;good&quot;
and &quot;bad &quot; attributes , with the &quot;good&quot; and&quot;bad&quot; coming from social
conditioning and &quot;socially accepted&quot; mores, i found myself striving to
become someone *I* didn't want to be . The &quot;how *you* feel and think is
good &quot; meme , in one of Rawn's earlier mails struck a chord and hence my
posts . One simple example is an item on my mirror &quot;Pride&quot; . I plonked
this into the &quot;black&quot; mirror and intended to work towards being &quot;humble&quot;
(culturally pride = bad, humility == good ).On reflection, i find there
are TWO kinds of hunility , &lt;&lt;

There are more than two kinds of humility and even more kinds of
&quot;pride&quot;. This is why I recommend that one not use such big words that
encompass so many possible meanings and work instead with *very* precise
statements that accurately describe *your* specific and unique character
trait. It's not as simple as merely making a list of words -- they must
each mean something *very* specific to *you*.

&gt;&gt; I am now redoing my mirror based on who and what *I* want to become .
&lt;&lt;

Excellent! :) :)

&gt;&gt; I guess in a nutshell, i find that many of my mirror items are
misclassified and the &quot;bad&quot; items have components of&quot;good&quot; and vice
versa .Now my mirror is looking very different , and many of my
&quot;positives&quot; and &quot;negatives&quot; don't look anything like my &quot;culture
sanctioned&quot; values . I guess there is still some residual confusion
there . &lt;&lt;

It is normal that as you learn about yourself and about the process,
your Mirrors will change to reflect your own greater understanding.

&gt; What did you think Bardon's listing of the positive and negative
&gt; characteristics was about if not a *universal* statement of positive
&gt; BEing?
&gt;&gt; Ahhh but i thought we should NOT rely on BArdon's charactersitics? &lt;&lt;

I believe that what I have said is that his list is not *enough* and
that while it might provide some general ideas we must not *rely* upon
it in whole. In other words, it does no good to just copy down the
words Bardon listed that we identify with. We *must* come up with our
*own* descriptions that accurately describe what *we* see inside of
*our* selves because, regardless of the fact that there are shared
Universal principles underlying our characters, we each express/manifest
them *uniquely*. Bardon could only point to or hint at these Universal
principles in very broad terms but could not have described their
*infinite* variety of expression.

&gt; How *you* feel *inside* is not rooted in your culture. It is
*modified*
&gt; by your culture, but the root is in *you* (i.e., the Individual Self).
&gt;&gt; ok . i need to think on this further . &lt;&lt;

I recommend that in addition to thinking about it further, you also
*observe* yourself in action. Analyze *yourself* instead what you
theorize are the possible motivations of others

&gt;&gt; i often found myself trying to be &quot;humble&quot; magnanimous&quot; etc and
feeling and being very ineffective in real world situations consequently
. &lt;&lt;

Then perhaps you are not being true to what these things really mean to
*you* or true to how *you* really feel in those situations.

&gt;&gt; I was just trying to make the point that with mirror work one should
become MORE effective not less in the physical world and if not there
is something wrong . I am sure it is blindingly obvious to lots of
people. :-| &lt;&lt;

Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say it's blindingly obvious to *lots*
of people. ;-) It is however a very valuable gauge of how you're doing
with your character transformation. By definition, when successful, the
character transformation *does* render you more effective in every
aspect of your life. If it's having the opposite effect then yes,
something is &quot;wrong&quot; with your process.

My best to you as always,
:) Rawn Clark
