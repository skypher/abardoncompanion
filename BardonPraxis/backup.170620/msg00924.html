<pre>As some of you may know, I am a member of a local university 
pagan/occult group that has discussions every week or so. While I 
haven't been able to attend for the past little while for various 
reasons, I made it a point to attend last weeks meeting due to the 
fact that the topic of discussion was the tree of life. While there 
was a lot of discussion, one really stuck in my mind and led me into 
a further insight into the three mother letters.

This insight from a fellow member came from me stating that the three 
mother letters where associated with various parts of the body: Shin; 
the head, Aleph; the chest and Mem; the stomach. Upon doing as such, 
he produced a diagram which placed the Hebrew letters one on top of 
the other as they would appear in the body. Which in turn produced an 
interesting pictograph of a human, in similar fashion to how IHVH is 
sometimes used to symbolize the human. Both diagrams are shown in the 
photo section.

Such a diagram would appear to be rather illustrative of the nature 
of these three mother letters as I understand them at the moment. On 
a rudimentary level, each letter shows it's elemental nature by it's 
image. Shin shows and upward and expansive movement towards heaven, a 
representation of the electric fluid. Aleph, with it's symmetrically, 
represents the balance between the electric and magnetic fluid. 
Whereas Mem, with it's circular imagery seems to accurately represent 
the cold, contractive nature of the magnetic fluid.

On a more physiological level, each letter represents the area within 
the human body. This is especially apparent when they are placed one 
on top of the other to create a human form. Shin shows a head and 
arms upraised in praise. Aleph seems to represent the whole chest 
area, with the three strokes that make up Aleph to represent the two 
lungs and the heart. Mem shows the abdominal area, with the strokes 
of Mem also seeming to represent the large intestine, and seems to 
allude to the other internal organs of the abdomen.

Just a few thoughts on the matter.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
