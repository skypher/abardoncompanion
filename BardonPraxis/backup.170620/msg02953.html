Hello everybody :)
Cherry blossom is a beautiful thing, all drink/food affects us all so 
differently. Coffee makes me very edgy I found, the instant kind is the worse 
for me. If its fresh I really enjoy drinking it, but very moderately, maybe 
once a month. Or go for decaff, but its not quite the same ;) What element 
corresponds to coffee? Chicory is also an excellent substitute for coffee,I do 
enjoy that.

Was it in Bardon somewhere? that I read that he used to drink his coffee black, 
and could also use it to see 'visions' reflected on the surface of the coffee? 
Can't remember where I read that now.

I Love tea :) The biggest change I noticed energetically was when I stopped 
taking white sugar and went to unrefined brown sugar, it made an amazing 
difference for my energy. I'm sure there is something in the refining process, 
which is not good for oneself..imo....but changing sugar is just something that 
worked for me. I did also find an article some time ago about an Ocultist that 
said the same thing, about sugar, I was like 'hey cool :) somebody else noticed 
too! Have to see if I can find that again, I'll share if I do.

I'll put the kettle on :)

Robert,
That is good to here because I have been drinking
coffee for about that long as well and after
attempting to quite a few times have finally
discovered I can drink it moderately with a balance of
more positive than negative effects. Did you know it
is said to be the most popular fruit that is consumed
in North and South America, being in the cherry
family. (~:

&gt; Coffee I have drank now for forty two years and am
&gt; still doing O. K. on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Last year someone sent me some research on a 20
&gt; year study of coffee drinkers and it was found that
&gt; coffee drinkers have 50 percent less diabetes then
&gt; those that do not drink it and those that drink
&gt; de-caff only had 25 percent less diabetes.
&gt; 
&gt; Robert
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have heard from seemingly reliable sources that
&gt; coffee is more 
&gt; electical/fire and more magnetic/water. My
&gt; personal sense is the 
&gt; former, but I am still pretty new to working with
&gt; elements. Can 
&gt; anyone shed some light on this for me?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks,
&gt; Chris
