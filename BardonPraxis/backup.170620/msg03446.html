&gt; Introduction to Magical Tools
&gt; 
&gt; 9 February 2003 (c)
&gt; 
&gt; This essay is a &quot;brief&quot; consideration of two related questions.
&gt; Does the mage need
&gt; particular magical tools, and can tools be substituted for each 
within a
&gt; ritual: especially wands
&gt; and athames.
&gt; 
&gt; What is magic?
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously, this question needs to be answered first in such a 
way
&gt; that it may inform the
&gt; discussion to follow. There are many definitions such as Crowley's
&gt; dictum that magic is
&gt; change accomplished by the force of will which are simply 
inadequate to
&gt; provide a clear picture
&gt; of what magical activity is, what the mage actually does, and how 
these
&gt; are different from the
&gt; activities and actions of other people.
&gt; Donald Tyson, in what has been called his &quot;New Magus&quot; system.
&gt; Defines Magic as
&gt; follows:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Every creative act is magical; and every magical act is
&gt; creative.
&gt; What can be predicted is not magic; what is magic cannot 
be
&gt; predicted.
&gt; Magic in action looks like luck.
&gt; Magic, like water, always seeks the easiest course.
&gt; Magic is unbounded by time and space.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I have a lot of respect for Mr. Tyson's work. In fact, the
&gt; writer expounds on these and
&gt; other 'Corollary's&quot; of Magic in his work entitled, _Ritual Magic: 
What
&gt; It Is and How to Do It_
&gt; (ISBN: 0-87542-835-5). However, I am not that sure that this
&gt; description adequately or even
&gt; accurately describes magic even though it definitely evokes much of 
the
&gt; aura of many magical
&gt; workings. The famous science fiction writer, Arthur C. Clark, 
made the
&gt; comment that, &quot;any
&gt; sufficiently advanced technology will appear to be magick to those 
with
&gt; lesser technologies.&quot;
&gt; The famous Martinist, &quot;Papus&quot; wrote: &quot;The application of the
&gt; strengthened human will
&gt; to accelerate the evolution of the living forces of Nature.&quot; 
(Papus,
&gt; Traite' Methodique de Magic
&gt; Pratique) &quot;Magic is the Science of Love.&quot; (Ibid.)
&gt; ,,, and ...
&gt; &quot;As a ... rule, the principal director... is the human will; 
the
&gt; means of action, the implement
&gt; used, is the astral or natural fluid, and the end to achieve is the
&gt; realization (generally on the
&gt; physical plane) of the ... operation. (Papus, La Science des 
Mages).
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps the following definition may be more functional for our
&gt; purposes.
&gt; MAGIC: the deliberate imposition of distinct 
pattern in
&gt; the reality / probability field
&gt; by application of imagination and will in such a manner as to 
utilize
&gt; energies and/or entities
&gt; which seem to function in a paranormal manner and / or according to
&gt; divergent cosmological
&gt; rules.
&gt; Another plausible treatment of the same idea could be that 
magic
&gt; consists in the
&gt; performance of certain physical actions which enable the mage to 
carry
&gt; out corresponding
&gt; actions on other planes so that certain events on those planes will
&gt; result in the manifestation of
&gt; particular, tangible consequences.
&gt; Some folks may argue about the last bit about &quot;tangible
&gt; consequences,&quot; but I hold that
&gt; without such consequences we have no means of verifying the 
efficacy of
&gt; a magical act.
&gt; 
&gt; Nor is magic the same as religion. The essence of religion is
&gt; relationship with some force
&gt; and/or mythos greater than the individual ego. The essence of 
magic
&gt; is deliberate, intelligent,
&gt; and creative manipulation of numinous forces. These forces and 
actions
&gt; may or may not be part
&gt; of the dynamic complexes which express that relationship with &quot;the
&gt; Divine.&quot; Indeed, often they
&gt; are quite mechanistic -- employing the subtle qualities of herbs,
&gt; crystals, and astrological
&gt; energies via the paranormal attributes of the magus, for instance.
&gt; Thus a mage may be involved deeply in religious activities, 
very
&gt; devout and pious. Yet
&gt; in the ultimate moment of magic, if the mage cannot authoritatively
&gt; express his or her own,
&gt; autonomous will and imagination, then the mage does not work magic 
but
&gt; merely prays. Some
&gt; mages will include a clause in their spells, such as the Wiccan &quot;an 
it
&gt; harm none,&quot; or the
&gt; Christian &quot;if it be Thy Will.&quot; These clauses have a value as fail 
safe
&gt; fall backs to protect the
&gt; mage and their environment from some of the consequences of 
inevitable
&gt; error. Yet the adept
&gt; should have such an harmony with the will of his or her tutelary 
that
&gt; they will know already that
&gt; their own will aligns with the will of their greater power. Hence, 
the
&gt; adept is, in the final
&gt; analysis, imposing the patterns of his or her own imagination 
willfully
&gt; upon the cosmos, not
&gt; pleading with another autonomous being to fulfill wishes.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you need tools?
&gt; 
&gt; Many writers proclaim that tools are not really necessary for 
the
&gt; proficient mage. They
&gt; hold that all magic is really accomplished by the mage's own aura or
&gt; imagination anyway and all
&gt; that tools really do is to reinforce the mage's visualization and
&gt; unconscious commitment and
&gt; expectations. I hold that this is patently false.
&gt; Frankly, a tool which functions primarily as a psychological
&gt; prompt is not well designed.
&gt; We are a tool using species, and our fundamental nature has evolved 
with
&gt; the assumption that
&gt; we will design and manipulate tools which will amplify our impact 
and
&gt; effect our desire far
&gt; more effectively than our naked bodies ever could.
&gt; When one considers the rule, &quot;as above, so below,&quot; then any
&gt; spiritual action should be
&gt; mirrored also by a physical impact as well. Indeed, this is one of 
the
&gt; fundamental principles in
&gt; magical practice, we do a physical act which has its spiritual 
impact
&gt; which in turn engenders
&gt; effects which eventually manifest on the mundane.
&gt; Furthermore, appropriately designed tools can affect a 
plethora of
&gt; poorly understood
&gt; energy fields, such as those several kinds found in the aura. 
Indeed,
&gt; almost any kind of
&gt; tool will impact your aura and modify it to some extent ... from a
&gt; living branch to a socket
&gt; wrench. Deliberately studying and incorporating these features 
should
&gt; clearly enhance the utility
&gt; of our ritual tools as well.
&gt; Obviously, while it is true that your aura and imagination are
&gt; absolutely key to the
&gt; operation of magic; they work by manipulating very real energies or
&gt; communicating with very
&gt; real entities. You can observe this mundanely by simply noticing 
the
&gt; effect you have on radio
&gt; and T.V. reception when you walk into or through the area in which 
it is
&gt; playing. Some folks
&gt; find that they destroy electric watches, others can't keep spring 
driven
&gt; watches running. More
&gt; advanced equipment will reveal the Kirilian field which surrounds 
you an
&gt; all living or even once
&gt; living things. Other gear can examine the infrared field generated 
by
&gt; your body. Extremely
&gt; expensive high tech equipment conducts C.A.T. and M..R.I. scans of 
your
&gt; body, relying upon
&gt; the magnetic and other energy fields which your body generates and
&gt; affects.
&gt; Therefore, it is obvious that just as your muscles can 
accomplish
&gt; many tasks but simple
&gt; tools make those muscles much more effective, likewise when your
&gt; imagination and auric
&gt; patterns begin to become effective; you can enhance their effect by
&gt; using appropriate tools.
&gt; Furthermore, while it is true that you could pass the electric
&gt; energy through your body to
&gt; light a light bulb; such behavior is risky, Moreover, your body 
cannot
&gt; sustain the kinds of intense
&gt; energy levels needed for modern society. Equally, as you advance in
&gt; your magical work, you
&gt; will find yourself accessing much more massive flows of energy and
&gt; vastly more intense entities.
&gt; Obviously, the simpler actions and charms would be just as easy for 
such
&gt; a practitioner with or
&gt; without tools. Equally obviously, there are situations in which 
proper
&gt; tools and procedures are
&gt; necessary as simple safety precautions.
&gt; Nor should one overlook the simple advantage of having tools 
which
&gt; are specifically
&gt; designed to accomplish the particular task. In every craft, 
esoteric or
&gt; exoteric, having the right
&gt; tools and being practiced with them causes the work to be better 
done.
&gt; Such tools also enable
&gt; you to exercise your creativity more freely, and ultimately, your
&gt; creativity is the root basis of any
&gt; magical accomplishments you hope to attain.
&gt; 
&gt; What do tools do?
&gt; 
&gt; Tools are impacted by and depend upon the old rule, &quot;As above, 
so
&gt; below, and vice
&gt; versa.&quot; Every act on any plane will echo and resonate on the other
&gt; planes. Thus your magic
&gt; involves physical actions and materials which are linked to
&gt; corresponding esoteric forces and
&gt; events. By increasing the material component in your rituals, you
&gt; create a larger effect in your
&gt; environment. The physical tool accesses more of the mundane and / 
or
&gt; psychological patterns
&gt; and energies in such a way as to also enhance the forces being 
involved
&gt; and manipulated on
&gt; other planes.
&gt; Secondarily, tools do aid psychological reinforcement. Your
&gt; emotional control and
&gt; intensity as well as your psychological states and subconscious
&gt; expectations have repeatedly
&gt; been proven to directly affect the efficacy of your magical or
&gt; paranormal work. The use of
&gt; special tools, garb, and symbols are all intended to evoke and to
&gt; reinforce those conditions.
&gt; However, this is hardly the limit of a truly magical tool's
&gt; contribution.
&gt; Even within this largely psychological realm the very presence 
of
&gt; the tool acts as a focus
&gt; for the unconscious participation. Hence using appropriate tools, 
which
&gt; you have drilled your
&gt; unconscious to recognize, triggers particular associations. In
&gt; consequence, it then will more
&gt; readily assist your whole personality to cooperate in the magic. 
Such
&gt; a focus also enables you
&gt; to be able to access those magical states even when you are 
physically
&gt; or emotionally impeded
&gt; by illness, stress, grief, or other condition.
&gt; Beyond the direct effect of the tool upon your own psyche, 
properly
&gt; consecrated and
&gt; designed tools will provide the symbolic talismen which will attract
&gt; notice and response from
&gt; entities whose existence is more noticeable on other planes. In 
fact,
&gt; because of this attraction of
&gt; the entities or energies connected with the tool, the tool also 
creates
&gt; a milieu which inhibits the
&gt; activity or presence of energies or entities which are not in 
harmony
&gt; with those you've selected
&gt; for consecrating and charging your tool.
&gt; Such entities are often quite volatile and require quite 
specific
&gt; handling. Just as
&gt; sometimes you find it difficult to tune your radio to the right 
station,
&gt; many times you will find it
&gt; difficult to bring your mind and spirit into the proper frequency 
for
&gt; communion with the forces
&gt; which you wish to evoke. Your creation of, consecration of, 
charging
&gt; of, and practice with your
&gt; magical tools will drill your mind into assuming those special 
states.
&gt; Such an aide is obviously
&gt; invaluable to direct the Beginner into proper relationship and
&gt; attitude. As you acquire more
&gt; practice, you may feel less need for such aides; yet if you 
continue to
&gt; recharge your tool, you
&gt; will find it will still enhance your practice noticeable in this 
way.
&gt; Not only will the presence of the tool enhance your ability to
&gt; enter quickly into the
&gt; magical connection, your frequent practice with it will cause it to
&gt; become an accustomed means
&gt; of access for those forces, entities, and/or energies which you
&gt; consistently evoke. As such, your
&gt; favorite tool can become a true nexus for the passage of magical 
reality
&gt; and beings. Just as it
&gt; aids you, it also comes to aid those with whom you work. Further, 
as
&gt; the tool provides an
&gt; exterior focus for the unconscious, it provides a kind of 
psychological
&gt; breaker between the
&gt; mental and spiritual stresses of your work and your own psyche. As 
a
&gt; result, tools facilitate your
&gt; releasing the spell so that the work will be free to manifest.
&gt; Ultimately, those forces which you have evoked and manipulated
&gt; through your tool
&gt; change the nature of the tool itself. Just as your body can cause 
such
&gt; changes in the reception of
&gt; the radio and generate such large fields of energy and special
&gt; environments, the tool will acquire
&gt; its own aura, fields, and patterns of energy. Some would even say 
it
&gt; acquires an intelligible
&gt; spirit with which you may communicate.
&gt; This acquisition of special energy fields is vital to the
&gt; importance of the right tool.
&gt; While you could use a bullet to replace a fuse in your car, as some
&gt; folks in Arkansas once did;
&gt; the probability is that when you do, your balls will get shot too. 
When
&gt; you use a tool to fashion
&gt; the pattern you have imagined and to direct the energies, you can 
create
&gt; vastly greater effects. I
&gt; do not think that muscle and bone alone could ever have created the
&gt; Mount Rushmore
&gt; Monument. You could try to pull together downed high power lines 
and
&gt; tie them together to
&gt; restore power, but I suspect that attempting to do so without proper
&gt; tools, garb, and technique
&gt; would be a trifle risky!
&gt; All too often, occult writers hasten to assure the reader that
&gt; everything is perfectly safe.
&gt; Balderdash! You can seriously injure yourself while sound asleep 
in
&gt; your own bed! You are
&gt; acquiring the skills to wield those powers which flow through and 
even
&gt; define your own soma /
&gt; body and psyche. Moreover, you encountering beings of a truly 
alien
&gt; nature. Such a being may
&gt; be perfectly friendly and love you intensely, but it may have a
&gt; metabolism based on nuclear
&gt; fusion or some such. Moreover, I don't care what your favorite
&gt; mythology is, predators,
&gt; parasites, and bullies are blatantly part of the cosmos. Imagine 
such
&gt; beings magnified into the
&gt; greater magical entities! Compare the spark you can create with 
your
&gt; body to the spark which
&gt; can jump from the generator or accelerator. If you can wield 
magical /
&gt; paranormal forces with
&gt; just your own body, what will those more enormous bodies and forces 
do?
&gt; Yes, you need tools for advanced work.
