<pre>Dear Pat,

&gt;&gt; I've studied a little William Misteles advises for beginners or those
who wish to go the hermetic path of Bardon. Right from the beginning,
mastering the first steps (before moving on to higher steps), there is
to achieve gradually: 1. The mental clarity of an advanced Zen master.
2. The concentration and artistic imagination of Stephen Spielberg. 3.
The ability to understand personal problems from a universal perspective
as one or two Ph.D.s in transpersonal psychology might impart. 4. The
level of vitality and chi possessed by a sixth don aikido sensei or a
fourth generation tai chi master. 5. The qualities of a successful
individual in any profession (endurance, hard-work and love your work
..) &lt;&lt;

These are not so much things you must strive to achieve as they are the
consequences of mastering the exercises. Also, Mr. Mistele seems to be
exaggerating a bit. :) I suggest that you not worry about it and just
do the exercises and see for yourself the ways in which *you* change and
grow.

&gt;&gt; An important question here, arises: Are the hermetic standarts of
requirements and concerning mastered progress rather internal or
external, rather inward or outward? &lt;&lt;

First and foremost these standards are internal but all internal change
has external consequence. Bardon is quite clear throughout IIH as to
what is required in order to consider an exercise &quot;mastered&quot;.

&gt;&gt; The other, even more challenging thing Mistele points out for Bardon
beginners, is to somehow find (not the perfection of course) but having
a deep commitment and identification with the highest light of Divine
Providence and finding within the sources of the divine qualities like
absolute faith/commitment (fire), all embracing love (water), sense of
wonder for life and detachment from personal problems (air) and silence
and hard-working endurance (earth) - to get free access to all those
sources even in some way * before * beginning with the first Bardons
exercises. (&quot;I suggest, then, at the very beginning of practicing with
Bardon that the student take stock of what his own individual sense of
the sacred and of transcendence is.&quot; W.M.) &lt;&lt;

I think you have misunderstood what Mr. Mistele was saying. All he is
saying is that you should spend some time meditating about these
qualities and about how you personally manifest them in your life. It's
not about &quot;free access&quot; to them but rather, about developing them within
yourself.

&gt;&gt; It's one thing to have high ideals and pursuing perfection, step by
step. &lt;&lt;

*That* is what is *required* and really what the process of &quot;initiation&quot;
is.

&gt;&gt; Another thing is to fully have access to those sources manifesting
and living them in daily life right away. &lt;&lt;

:) I don't believe this was what Mr. Mistele was suggesting.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
