<pre>Hey Chuck,

&gt;&gt;Then I take that thought 
to sleep with me to be worked on in the subconscious as I impregnate 
the opposite characteristic from the negative and it works....
There are many fine tools to deal with negating the negative trait, 
also I find that I spend time inbreathing the Divine virtue that is 
the opposite of the negative trait.&lt;&lt;


That all sounds good to me too. I agree that the tools provided are very 
good and effective even in step 1. In fact I sometimes find myself in the 
paradoxical position of why bother to progress! I also think Bardon's genius 
was in 
writing something so infinitely flexible and yet so definite. We all start 
from such different places.

My only other comment on the whole process so far is that the mental helps 
with the astral. As in, once you get good at Thought Discipline you can 
meditate on the tetragrammaton itself and its significance, and then be 
constantly 
aware, initiate a kind of rolling program of mirror work, doesn't even need to 
be written down in a way, of observing its operation in your life. Can all 
sort of be noted as you go and even start to be corrected on the spot day to 
day. I find that really helpful. Life gets to be your mirror.

I don't find the whole 'opposite characteristic' thing works for me so well 
though. As in, you felt fear so you breathe in courage - because it seems too 
general.... do you know what I mean? What I feel works best personally is 
really like one of those old 'choose your own adventure' books - where you took 
what seems a wrong turn. You turn back and see what you should have done. It a
ll kind of comes down to knowing what one should do but being afraid of 
opening oneself to love - fear and love seem like the uber-fault and 
uber-virtue 
if you like.

So I kind of ask myself the question, 'What would I have to have been 
feeling/believing/thinking/etc. to have acted differently?' And the cool thing 
is 
if you phrase it like that it's always a positive, never negative. Then 
breathe that in and just be confident you've changed. This way your life 
becomes a 
story you're writing. Which is like saying, until you do step 1-3 life is 
writing you!

It reminds me a bit of what Rawn describes in the 'Centre of Stillness' 
meditation, where you lift yourself up and look down and see all the threads of 
your life, and you can reposition them. I seem to understand these threads as 
stories that one is involved in. It helps too with all the grading, of what 
you want to tackle 1st etc., especially with a problem I keep having which is 
wanting to solve it all, *now*! That could be described as a change of tone 
in the narrator's voice maybe, as in I need to learn to tell myself the story 
of myself as calmly as possible! But I love reading and stories so this is why 
it works this way for me. In general I think whatever one loves is going to 
be helpful.

best to you, Jason
