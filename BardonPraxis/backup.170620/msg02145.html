<pre>Hi,

I understand your take on competition; but there is only one goal of 
competition to elevate somebody to the position of superior and one 
to inferior.

The entire process creates disequilibrium and is unnecessary in a 
divine sense; anyone partiaking in any competition, unless iwth a 
desire to lose in the first palce si still hoping to create a 
disequilibrium in a situation which did not previously exist. Any 
magician who knowingly desires to create such a disequilibrium, 
especially with regards to his own &quot;enjoyment&quot; will find many 
obstacles in his way further down the path.

Furthermore, even if your intention was perfect and he above 
statement untrue; you are unable to take in to account the negative 
emotions created within your opponent if you do win and are thus 
generating a negative breeding pool. Competition is human baggage 
unless specifically necessary pertaining to physical survival, and 
even then has to be seriously considered.

Mark

&gt; Hello. Thank you for your post. However, I respectfully disagree 
with your 
&gt; conclusion. There is even the taste of competition within your 
post.
&gt; 
&gt; I would favor the hypothesis that &quot;part of magical initiation&quot; is 
to not be 
&gt; seduced into worshipping at the alter (metaphor) of competition.. 
it takes 
&gt; ones focus form the goal... and that depends upon what the desire 
is in 
&gt; relation to, rather than the idea of &quot;competition&quot; itself.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider the &quot;balancing of the elements&quot;, even that is in a sense 
a 
&gt; competition between focuses (competition between neg/pos elemental 
balances? 
&gt; insecurities? etc... THe very act of seeking balance, one must 
refocus 
&gt; elsewhere... and that can mean a 'competing' focus of will 
(interruptions, 
&gt; etc.) .
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that the ideal competetive sense is not RAMMED into 
anyone. It is 
&gt; a common experience in anything that exists. WHat we do with it 
and how much 
&gt; we surrender to the negative OF the concept, is again, a 
competiton, AND of 
&gt; our own choosing based upon our own interpretation relative to our 
own 
&gt; priorities and self understanding..
&gt; 
&gt; but alas, is also a seduction into the glamour of a type of 
superiority 
&gt; based within the hiding of our own insecurity.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps the REAL &quot;part of the magical intiation&quot; is to not be 
threatened BY 
&gt; the concept and try top get rid of it, accept it as within its 
sphere, enjoy 
&gt; it where one may and never to lose sight that IT (the act or 
desire to 
&gt; compete) is not who or what we are, but something we either wish 
and choose 
&gt; to enjoy or not (and in an ethical and balanced, concientious and 
respectful 
&gt; manner.
&gt; 
&gt; THen the sting and the glamour may be removed from it and we can 
again set 
&gt; it upon its correct and balanced course as well as place in 
manifestation.
&gt; 
&gt; It has been said that &quot;The mind cannot move AWAY from anything, 
only TOWARD 
&gt; something else.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Rest,

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hi guys,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Interestingly part of the magical initiation is a recognition 
that all 
&gt; &gt;forms of competition are worthless; a very hard part for many 
people to let 
&gt; &gt;go from given how competing is rammed into everyone from early 
age. It is 
&gt; &gt;based on the principal of balance, and that the only perfect 
result in any 
&gt; &gt;competition is for two oposing parties to draw / tie which 
renders the 
&gt; &gt;point of competing in the first place useless. If you beat 
someone, you are 
&gt; &gt;better in that instance than they, and there is no point in 
beating 
&gt; &gt;somebody not as strong in a certain competitive event than you - 
other than 
&gt; &gt;for self gratification, ego, killer instinct etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Martial artists, particualrly those who actively compete, or even 
at the 
&gt; &gt;sparring level, have to try to hit your opponent - unless yoru 
colleagues 
&gt; &gt;are willing to just let you parry, which is still a form of 
competition 
&gt; &gt;thus like many things, at a certain level it just has to go!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I had to give up Judo 6 months back, there was just no point any 
more!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The other Mark

&gt; &gt;Hi Zach,
&gt; &gt;I wish to take the next step in building a non harming
&gt; &gt;vibration in my field. Sparring generates too much
&gt; &gt;static in the field. Ideally one should be empty
&gt; &gt;during sparring but in this case it is easier to just
&gt; &gt;let the 28 year habit go. Everything has an end.
&gt; &gt;Blessings

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Mark,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I''m interested why are you giving up martial arts,
&gt; &gt; &gt; do you find practising
&gt; &gt; &gt; them clashes with your Bardon practice?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; best
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Zach
