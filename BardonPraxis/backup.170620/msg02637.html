<pre>Hello Rawn and all the members;

My name is Dasha. I am 32 years old. I was born and raised in 
Slovakia, former Czechoslovakia. Seven years ago an unknown power had 
imbued my spirit with restlessness and filled my soul with hunger for 
adventure. The part of me that was brave enough to claim my own path 
and follow it broke up from the conformity of familiar routines and 
decided to move to Canada. Currently, I am living in Vancouver, BC.

During these years, innumerable challenging situations and 
relationships often overshadowed the primordial promise of venture 
and dizzy new perspectives. I often found myself exploring the very 
limits of my potential. However, now I know that without being 
exposed to the soul-bleaching effect of the lifestyle of the Gipsy, 
the new connection to my true self, and life as a whole, wouldn't 
emerge in my consciousness. 

I firmly believe that we can create a better world only through 
improving the individual; therefore, I am passionately concerned with 
my personal growth and development. I constantly strive to discover 
who I am and how I can become my best possible self. During this 
ongoing search I've been greatly benefiting from studying Mysticism, 
Anthropology, Sophiology, Theology, Rosicrucianism, Esoteric 
Christianity, Western Occultism, Tantra/Kundalini Yoga, Transpersonal 
Psychology and Psychology. I am also a Reiki Master/Teacher. It 
doesn't matter what I am doing, it's about how much love I can put 
into doing that really counts. Also, I feel the best when the work I 
am doing is clearly helping those to whom I can be most useful. 

My interest in the occult was awakened by a necessity of finding 
explanations to several &quot;paranormal&quot; experiences that started 
occuring in my life when I was a teenage girl - out of body 
experience during an operation and spontaneous kundalini awakening 
being among the most influential. 

I was very pleased when a Czech friend of mine introduced me to 
Bardon several years ago. It was like finding a spring of fresh water 
after traveling through a dry desert. I needed it badly. I was tired 
of a constant Cinderella chore - sorting out the seeds from the ashes 
of worthless literature. I've studied all his works theoreticaly in 
English and Czech. I've been deeply touched by Franz Bardon's 
courage, integrity, honesty, compassion and concern for students' 
well being.

Rosemary Altea once said:&quot;There is no magic potion that gives us 
wisdom. Only our experience will teach us and then, only if we are 
truly willing to learn&quot;. Therefore, I also started working through 
the IIH. I am currently in Step 1. 

To sum up my experience: I started my journey feeling &quot;There must be 
the key to mysteries somewhere out there&quot;. Then, as I continued 
growing, I believed several times &quot;I have found the key&quot; and &quot;I've 
had the key&quot;. The true knowing has downed upon me only 
recently: &quot;I AM THE KEY TO ALL THE MYSTERIES !&quot; and I laughed. The 
greatest &quot;secrets&quot; usually turn out to be very simple. I was 
searching for something all around me while I had it within me all 
the time!

Now, it's my firm hope that with the help of Franz Bardon's system of 
initiation, I will learn how to use the Key properly to unlock the 
Doors to Mysteries. I wish similar success to all the honest seekers 
on the path. 

I'd like to ask you two questions to start:
1. I have been researching Kundalini for serveral years now. This 
phenomena is very well known and studied in the East; therefore, all 
my knowledge is related to their ways of understanding it . Bardon 
touches the subject of Kundalini Yoga only lightly. He only says that 
Kundalini is the very force of &quot;imagination&quot; with witch the magic is 
concerned. This explanation is not sufficient for me to understnad 
how to connect my knowledge to the descriptions in Bardon's work. 
Could anybody help me to understand the connections between 
the &quot;serpent power&quot; and the &quot;power of imagination&quot; and the way this 
power is used in Bardon's system of initiation?

2. Silence is one of the fundamental attributes of every magician. It 
is said that every magician has to be silent about his knowledge and 
experiences if she/he wants to progress. How do you see the issue of 
silence as oppose to sharing the info in a group like this? Where is 
the boundary? What are the karmic consequences?

All the best;
Dasha
