<pre>Dear Rawn,

I've recently read your article about Sowantha, and it sparked a few 
questions in me.

First, you have said that the Greater Selves project and condense 
their awarenesses into Individual Selves, who inhabit the time-space 
realm which results from the projection process. I assume that every 
Greater performs his projection &quot;by himself&quot; (the other way around 
would have no difference between that joint Gathering of Greaters 
acting as one and Kether, somewhat eliminating the need for their 
existence). So, if each Greater Self performs his projection 
individually, and each projection results in the creation of a time-
space universe, how come the time-space realm all the Individual 
Selves descend into is the same one (the one all of us currently 
inhabit)? Or if it is not the same one, and every Individual 
descends into the realm made by his specific Greater - thus having 
every physical universe inhabited only by the projections of a 
single Greater? This second option seems rather illogical to me, 
since it would prevent connections being made between Individuals of 
different Greaters.

Second, by the principle of correspondence, would a very advanced 
person be able to mentally mimic the process of creation? What I 
mean by that, is to project from himself new Greater Selves (not 
stemming from Kether or his own Greater/Individual Self, but from 
his Personal Self), having them project Individual Selves into a new 
time-space realm (created from/within that person's mental level), 
who will manifest as autonomic Personal Selves in that new physical 
world. Those Personas will exist in a level of time-space &quot;one 
notch&quot; below the one of that creating person, so that from their 
perspective, that creating person will be infinite. Essentially, to 
create a new Tree within, using Malkuth of the Main Tree as the 
kether of the new one.

I hope the above questions didn't come out overly convoluted, or too 
far-fetched :)
Also, I'd like to apologize in advance for an upcoming stream of 
questions; my current practices are going along great, so I yearn 
for answers to many philosophical/theoretical questions plaguing my 
intelligence in the meanwhile - and my current level of experience 
is not enough to meditate to their answers by myself :) I just 
thought it would be rather inappropriate to cram all of them into 
one post, and it would be better to ask them one by one slowly over 
time :)

Lastly, I'd like to wish you success with your new book about the 
Perception of Essential Meaning - I'm sure it will be great :)

Sincerely,
Daniel
