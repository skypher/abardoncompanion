<pre>Dear Daniel:

I think infinite possibilities lie in the law of Cause and Effect. Everything 
that we perceive with our physical senses is an effect. Cause is always 
invisible. When we take the cause of things back far enough it becomes 
unexplainable and invisible. Ultimate Cause is invisible, although we can 
observe it's presence in the effects.

Another way of interpreting the Hermetic Principle, &quot;As above, so below. As 
below, so above&quot;, in the Law of Cause and Effect, is that every Cause has an 
Effect and every Effect has a Cause. Infinite possibilities lie within this 
law. It is possible to change the effects, by identifying with Cause. Herein 
lies infinite possibilities within a fixed law.

&gt; My stumbling point is, that everything is still subject to absolue

absolute and fixed and within the physical world, there is a tangible 
(if almost infinitely massive) amount of space in which things 
attached to said universal laws can happen.

Dear Mark,

I would like to bring up two thoughts related to the issue.
First, regarding the claim that there is a tangible amount of space 
in which nature can take its course; is not the physical realm as 
infinite as the astra-mental realms? Even modern science seems to 
confirm this thought.
If it is indeed so, then even if there was a fixed number of absolute 
universal Laws which work like mathematical functions (producing a 
*single* output for every possible input), there would still be a 
genuinly infinite amount of physical space for them to manifest in.

Second, regarding absolute Laws. Let's take the Law of Cause and 
Effect, for example. I think it was David Hume who postulated that 
there is no logical connection between causes and their effects. 
Proceeding from this thought, I, personally, believe that different 
effects might rise from exactly the same causes.
To me, the Law of Cause and Effect is responsible for teaching, for 
allowing us to learn from the results of our actions. Given a 
specific constant environment and specific cause, an infinite amount 
of possibilites of effects arise, an infinite amount of ways to 
express and teach the lesson needed. All these possibilities are 
simultaneously included in the All, and yet, given the sequential 
nature of human perception, we seemingly experience the lesson in 
only one of the possible ways.

The two above thoughts, if correct of course, already give us an 
infinite amount of space in which an infinte amount of events 
happen. :)

Hoping to be clear enough to be of any help,
Daniel
