Hi Larry
Hi all

O.K. Your are right as far as the basic procedure of introspection of 
Bardon concerns.
Let me put the question in a (hopefully *smile*) more clear way:

Suppose it is enough, not just basic introspection step 1 ( I agree 
with you to do it basically as Bardon suggests! O.k.!) but also the 
three approaches of step 2 were enough alone to bring all (most of) 
your negative traits of all past incarnations into basic required 
Equilibrium without considering any problem of correlation between 
*mental root/feeling and transcending family constellations* or the 
*mind-body question* (which is not the same as mind-action 
question!). 
Then, nevertheless, since I consider hermetic to be a science (the 
highest science existing on Earth) and not just a religious path you 
blindly follow, hermetic should be able to explain *why* and *how*, 
if root cause is &quot;thinking&quot; within the mental, to change
your mental-thinking pattern together with feeling?acting is
mere able *alone* to transmute automatically such family 
constellation or to transmute physical constitution (which correlates 
with character) as well?

Let's even put the question in another way; let's assume
somebody who has been working with autosuggestions, replaced bad 
behaviour with good one etc. for long time but not so successfully. 
Then he tries some other methods like Hellinger family constellation 
or homeopathy ? and its is quite common that those methods can
bring about radical change (radical-root-radix)! ? the question
remains: Why was affirmation/transmutation/behaviour-changing not 
enough alone (or what did that persons wrong or miss or not 
consider), when the root cause just lies within thinking, as it is 
said?

It's less about that I or you *have* to do *all* those methods
and stuff or just any one of them at all but rather about getting a 
deeper understanding what &quot;thinking&quot; itself is or what
&quot;constitution&quot; is (what about DNA/genes and
emotional-thinking-
patterns?) and how theses two - *body-mind* - are related or 
correlated (or individual mind-familyspirit), since as Rawn once said 
himself, the final goal *why* you do that is to transform *root 
cause*, not just your symptoms in order to achieve real Equilibrium.

Nowadays, most scientists or philosophers consider the root cause of 
human behaviour or counsciousness within the physical body (also 
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Principle or Paul Allen FB Research), 
although &quot;philosophy of mind&quot; is not yet resolved completely and some 
scienticst agree that reprogramming is possible and therein lies a 
little freedom a human being has - generally human beings 
just &quot;think&quot; to have free will although they don't.

When Bardon was alive, such questions were not as vital as they are 
presently, but if we really want to consider hermetics as serious all-
embracing science, such problems can not be just ignored.

With best regards
Patrik

&gt; Hi Y'all
&gt; You make the introspection part seem so confusing....
&gt; Here is how I did
&gt; I would do a life review and see how I acted in as many events as  
I could
&gt; remember.
&gt; Then I would classify them according to the elements and subdivide 
their
&gt; frequency accordingly.
