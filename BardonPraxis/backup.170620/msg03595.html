John,

While I have far less experience than Rawn in this area, your 
question does remind me of a personal experience. I was involved with 
an ongoing research project that, as I came to know, was centered 
around Qabalistic symbolism. As with yours, there was an individual, 
long deceased, who I associated with this project. As time went 
along, I found myself sort of walking in his shoes. I knew he was a 
student of Qabala. For unrelated reasons, I found myself studying 
Qabala. From what I had seen of his writings, I knew that he was very 
altruistic, though most didn't consider him such. As my spirituality 
evolved, I found myself becoming more and more so, myself. In fact, 
the whole purpose of my quest evolved. Looking back, I see now that I 
had unconsciosly aligned my consciousness in many ways with his. One 
day, when I woke up, I was &quot;given&quot; some information. I had just begun 
work and was desparately trying to do something else, but was 
compelled to doodle. These doodles contained lots of stuff, new, 
unrelated to anything I was doing, and dead-on what I needed to 
progress to the next level. This happened a couple of days in a row, 
each time right after waking, then it stopped. Whether it came 
from &quot;him,&quot; the source that gave it to him, or wherever, I don't 
know. The sensation was like my first grade teacher taking my hand 
and helping my write my alphabet.&quot;Here, do it this way.&quot; I realized 
at the time that what I been given was pretty big. I remember that 
for several days, I was both elated and overwhelmed with gratitude. 
Pretty neat.

One other thing I will mention. At the time of this, I was meditating 
on the center of Case's Cube of Space. (Not the card represented, but 
the center of the actual figure) Some of these were very, very 
intense. In one of his books, Case says that the center represents 
the 5th dimension. Related? I don't know.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Friends....for a particular course of study I'm engaged in, I 
want to
&gt; access the thoughts and knowledge of a man who died in the 
1950's....I'm
&gt; currently working my way through Step 1 and this kind of exercise 
isn't
&gt; addressed in IIH until later. I would appreciate some wisdom. &lt;&lt;
&gt;
