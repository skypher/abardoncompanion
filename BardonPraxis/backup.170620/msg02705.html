Thanks for all those informations. You give more than i expected. 

When i was younger, i've once seen an UFO so when i came to this
information of Merkabah and vehicle of conscience i knew it could be
interresting. Then Few years ago altough i didn't knew nothing about
magical things, during a night two angels lead me into a small Ship
and we travelled out of earth and into space, first step on the moon,
i've seen other humans like me who were there to ''visit'' and an
humano&#xEF;d being who seems not to be from earth and who looks like an
''instructor''. He gave us some information about the moon and this
sphere and we have visited some places around. And then we went to the
other planets. I was surprised, we could see a big screen in the ship
and there where a lot of information about all that exist and happened
in our solar system on different planes. I was so surprised, on this
screen the planets of our solar system had different colors other than
those we can see on earth. Sometimes i think all this could traveling
inside of me and interacting with my own soul and gardian angel and
not really extra-terrestrials stuff... Later when i discovered PME i
was convinced that it was not only a ''dreaming''.


I like much this idea of working with the elements with the merkabah.
And i guess i'll do this as soon as i'll mastered the IIH. 

Thanks again

&gt; To my knowledge &amp; in my experience...
&gt; 
&gt; If one is practicing Bardon hermetics &amp; one is doing his IIH situps,
then the experiences with accumulating, forming &amp; condensing energi
/should bring about/ better results in building a better quality of
vehicle, no ?
&gt; 
&gt; When I came across Merkabah information years back, it just seemed
like a more intricate/specific version of what I was allready doing on
my own. But I took some notes. I either intergrated some merkabah-type
thinking into my magick circle creation 
&gt; and/or I injected alot of IIH elemental equilibrium into my vehicle
creation.
&gt; Either way, I'm pleased with the results.
&gt;  
&gt; I know they're not technically related, but isnt the idea &amp;
application of the Merkabah very similar to astral/mental wandering ?
&gt; But rather than plunging into an ocean and swimming naked in the
unknown depths, build your own, personal, inter-stellar submarine.
&gt; 
&gt; Whenever I enter magical trance-space, after the circle is formed &amp;
the LBR performed, elements are called &amp; associated with etc... I know
I am ready for magical work ( usually evocation ) once I can feel the
sphere around me form a cohesive field which feels a bit like a
constructed vehicle around me that I can de-tach from the physical
room &amp; travel to wherever.
&gt; Nothing fancy, just a sphere of formed thought and energi with a +
running down from the top, thru me, to the bottom and another +
running from right, thru me, to the left, and one more from back to front.
&gt; In fact my impression at the time of first doing it was the
realazation that the 'words' of the LBR are, perhaps, nothing more
than a reminder to the subtle energy bodies to do this, to form an
axis, an intersection of consious energy which forms the vehicle and
amplifies AKASHIC consiousness.
&gt; 'You are.... this universe' = where the divine
meets/intersects with the material.
&gt; 'The power... and the glory' = where the electric intersects the
magnetic.
&gt; 'Forever... and ever' = where the past intersects
with the future.
&gt; To my understanding of magical trancespace, THAT is where you want
to be.
&gt; Thats the Archimedies point, a place of power.
&gt; 
&gt; As with many magical technologies, the first 100 or so times one
does this, he has to do all the mental/astral grunt work himself,
uphill, both ways, every nut, every bolt, every time. But once it gets
ingrained, after patterns of repitition have been established, it
requires only a nod, a word or a subtle gesture to 'boot up' the
entire program.
&gt;  
&gt; I might be speaking the obvious or preaching to the choir on the
usefulness of vehicles of consiousness, 
&gt; if so just move along, nothing to see here folks. 
&gt; 
&gt; And not only power, but protection. Maybe everyone is braver than
me, but before *I* dive into an ocean, at least or my first few trips,
I want something inbetween 'me' and the jellyfish. 
&gt; When you know your vehicle is well-built, you know that nothing can
harm you. Its that kind of security that allows one to boldly travel
inward &amp; encounter strange new worlds with calmness, curiosity &amp;
wisdom, so you can actually enjoy the experience and give in to the
wonder... rather than always looking over your shoulder waiting for
the boogy-woogie to jump out and get you.
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine what your 'vehicle of consiousness' looks like from the outside.
&gt; If theres a strong-willed god-man ( mage ) in the center of a craft
that is composed of refined &amp; condensed thought &amp; energi,
&gt; and he is seated in the center of 3 equi-distant crosses... no
vampires of any kind are going to want to mess with that.
&gt; As opposed to someone crusing around in a rickety old boat,
sputtering along in space leaking fluids &amp; gasses, 
&gt; if that person finds himself in a rougher part of town, hostiles
might see him as an easy target &amp; move in to mess with him.
&gt; And why shouldn't they ?
&gt; He IS an easy target, his resources will be easy to steal/feed upon.
&gt; 
&gt; So never skimp on the construction-quality of your akashic starship.
&gt; In some ways it's your resume'
&gt; It shows your ability, or lackthereof.
&gt; From the outside, all the weaknesses in your craft ( and therefore
in you ) can be seen.
&gt; Tech-knowledge-y. A technical application of knowledge.
&gt; Whether its electrial engineering, political science or condensing
elemental fluids.
&gt; One advertises alot more about himself than he realises, by the
quality of the ship that he creates.
&gt; Whenever I meet 'alien' entities, I theorhetically reverse-engineer
thier ships to better understand where they are coming from.
&gt; Not just to defeat/destroy/defend against, but to understand.
&gt; 
&gt; And just to beat the starship/magical vehicle annalogy to death, I
call up the elements one at a time &amp; load qualities from that element
into my craft to give it the abilities/affinities/gifts that that
element has to offer.
&gt; Some examples are :  
&gt; Fire = thrusters, acceleration, fire-power. Water = magnetic
containment, tractor-beam, intake ports. Air = long-range scanners,
view-screen, cloaking device. Earth = Hull integrity, shields,
density, etc...
&gt; In my experience ( if this thread even relates to what was asked )
when we encounter something unfriendly/hostile/creepy
&gt; we tend to 'freak out' alot less if we view it through the window or
see it on long-range scanners, than we do if it appears right up in
your face. I use alot of air-element in my ships, because I like some
space between me &amp; everything else.
&gt; 
&gt; I like building structures ( astral constructs ) that actually stay
'solid' and retain thier shape, form &amp; function even when my attention
is focused elsewhere. What good are solid walls &amp; floors if they
flicker out of solidity/existance everytime your mind isn't 100% focused
&gt; on the task of keeping them from dissapating away into gossamer ?
&gt; People often use the word 'Artifical' as a derrogatory term. To my
understanding, everything that came after the initial primal elements
of the universe, has been Arti-ficed in some manner or another. Taking
some energy, heat it up, hammer it into form, cool it off so that it
holds its new form is what its all about. Otherwise its just an idea
that fades away when you look away.
&gt; An Artifact is simply Art ( a vision, an idea ) that has been made
into a fact ( given actuality )
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; I d'ont know if you have heard of Drunvalo Melchisedeck who talks
&gt; about the sacred gemoetry, flower of life and the merkabah (the
&gt; lightbody). In the merkabah m&#xE9;ditation he says you activate the
&gt; lightbody structure by breathing and accumulating the prana 18th time
&gt; along a tube in your back similar to the sushumna with the chakras
system.
&gt; He explains that the mental body is electric in nature and the astral
&gt; body is magnetic. By breathing and condensing prana in the geometry
&gt; structure of these bodys which are a pairs of tetrahedrons (like the
&gt; 6point star but in 3D), and once you've condensed enough energy in
&gt; you, you blow it outside and then make the structure rotate, the
&gt; mental sould turn tetrahedron counter-clockwise and the astral
&gt; tetrahedrons clockwise, you can activate the lightbody (which looks
&gt; like an UFO once activated) and travel in every dimensions and planes
&gt; in the universe. He says a lot of extra-terrestrials do the same with
&gt; their ships that are often lightbodies. 
&gt; 
&gt; When i discovered Bardon i was so surprised i found there are some
&gt; similarity in the two technics like accumulating and condensing the
&gt; vital energy in the body or traveling trough the other realms. And
&gt; making theses geometric structure (electric vs magnetic) spining
&gt; together in the merkabah meditation looks like when Bardon talks about
&gt; making a big electro-magnetic Volt.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Yah, but in this 'volt' YOU are the creamy-fire center !
&gt; If my calculations are correct, entire chapters could be ( and
should be ) written on the topic of Volting.
&gt; I wish someone more 'advanced' than me, would get on that. ;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I suspect some properties of 'pore-breathing' are very useful
in this type of starship-of-consiousness approach.
&gt; Especially in regards to propulsion. When I first got started, I
found it useful to inhale from the front pores of the craft and exhale
out of the pores/ports/gills in back. This created a jet-propulsion
system that felt very natural and effective. 
&gt; Fish have known this trick of fluid dynamics for years.
&gt; Now so do we.
&gt; 
&gt; Also.. one last note :
&gt; I've always used merkabah-type thinking/mediation/practice as a
'cohesiveness of consiousness' training-wheel. 
&gt; A template of sorts.
&gt; I have found that when wandering other realms/planes/domains that
it's all about cohesion, of consiousness. 
&gt; Whatever trick or tech one employs that helps one keep thier
awareness together while having a conversation with an
elemental/genii/angel, I say employ. Use whatever works to keep the
communication channels CLEAR.
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine if someone called you up for some assistance in an area that
you are knowledgeable in, and while you were talking with them in your
room that person keeps changing color, changing form, fading in &amp;
flaking out... hard to have a coherrent conversation with someone like
that. If the phoneline keeps cutting out or the video signal keeps
getting garbled, then it makes it difficult to understand what
information is being imparted.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hope my insights were helpful, or at least amusing.
