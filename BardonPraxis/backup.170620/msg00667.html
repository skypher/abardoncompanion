<pre>Dear Chenxsi,

&gt;&gt; Is this approach alrite? Hey erm..dun laugh at me if i am doin
something out of ignorance! &lt;&lt;

The question of &quot;alrightness&quot; for *you* can only be answered by trying
it out and seeing if it works. However, it concerns me that you have
repeatedly expressed reluctance/resistance to doing the soul mirror work
in the way that Bardon described it. While it's not for me to judge
your rationale for this, I would urge you to examine the whys and
wherefores behind it. Is it really based upon self-knowledge of what's
&quot;right&quot; for *you* or is it rooted in avoidance of otherwise unpleasant
work?

&gt;&gt; I find that the personality is constantly changing every second, and
oftenly, most of the things that i've noted down in my astral mirrors
will either change in their nature one way or another, or completely
dissappear with time. &lt;&lt;

Yes, but the whole point of the soul mirror work is that you take
control of your personality and intentionally and consciously change it.
It's true that all things change, given sufficient time, but leaving
your personality transformation up to the whims of nature is not what
Bardon has suggested by any stretch of the imagination.

&gt;&gt; Sometimes, the moment i write down a negative trait, i can feel
strongly as if it is already acknowledged and gone! &lt;&lt;

Yes, but are these changes factual or merely a feeling? Are they
permanent changes or only momentary?

&gt;&gt; Its tedious to constantly change my mirrors here and there, therefore
i've decided to adopt a new approach to my mirrors---by simply observing
my emotions and thoughts every moment in life. For e.g, when i have a
desire to play computer games again, i would pinpoint the mental thought
of playing computer, and &quot;feel&quot; the emotions that are attached to that
mental thought. After i am part of the emotions, i will consciously
alter the emotions and thoughts to one that is more beneficial to me.
Sort of like acting i guess.. &lt;&lt;

This is a viable technique. In fact, it's one of the techniques that
Bardon enumerates in Step Two. However, used by itself, it's purely
situational and lacks any sort of comprehensive, holistic approach to
transformation of the overall personality structure.

I say these things to you because I know from personal experience how
important the soul mirror work of character analysis and self-change is
to the *whole* of Bardon's system of initiation. While it is crucial
that we personalize the system, it's equally important that we adhere to
its basic structure in order to progress within it. Bardon instructed
very specifically for the reason that the specifics are important to
future success.

The question therefore is whether or not your personalization of the
soul mirror work has strayed too far from the basic structure to
guarantee future success. This, of course, is a question that can only
be answered by your own trial-and-error experimentation. I hope you
will keep us posted on how this works out for you. :)

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
