<pre>Dear BardonPraxis members,

I need a break so I'm going to take a big one. :) It's been around two
years since I've taken any sort of serious holiday from my online
responsibilities -- so long in fact, that I've forgotten what it's like
to arise without &quot;turn on the computer&quot; being the first order of
business each day and &quot;turn off computer&quot;, the last. I need more than
just a day or two that isn't filled with questions so I'm going to take
31 of them in a row! ;-)

I've decided to go play for the entire month of March, which in my part
of the world is the beginning of Spring. At the moment the new grasses
are G-R-E-E-N and offer my eye THE TRUE definition of &quot;lush&quot; and
&quot;verdant&quot;. All of the Plum and Cherry trees are bursting with bloom,
right on the heels of the glorious Acacia. The Buckeye's are all
sprouting their green, green, green new leaves. Even the grand Oaks are
showing the gold and cinnabar of emerging leaves! Obviously, this is my
most favorite time of year. :) I need to go watch the flowers bloom
and inhale them deeply; sit next to the new grass and discuss world
affairs; sit beside my favorite creek and merge with the rushing water;
dance with the bees amid the plum blossoms, etc., etc.

&gt;From mid-July, 2002 through late-April of this year is the period of my
&quot;Saturn Opposition&quot;. This means that Saturn (who is coming the closest
to the earth that it's come in a LONG time) is now in the opposite
degree of the zodiac than it was when I was born. This is an
interestingly different phase of Saturn than the &quot;Saturn Return&quot; (when
Saturn passes the same spot in the zodiac it was at birth). This
opposition requires certain things of me, one of which is to deeply
re-connect with what inspired me in the first place so that that
inspiration can mature and continue forward anew.

So, while I'm off re-charging my batteries (March 1st through 31st), I
won't be participating in any online discussion groups and will be
replying only to urgent or really important personal emails. If you
really do need to reach me, write to me directly. During March, several
days will pass between times of even turning my computer on, so please
don't expect many quick replies! ;-)

In my absence, Greg M has kindly agreed to take over moderator
responsibilities for the list. He will be responsible for approving or
rejecting posts and helping you if you have any technical problems with
your membership.

My best to you all,
:) Rawn Clark
