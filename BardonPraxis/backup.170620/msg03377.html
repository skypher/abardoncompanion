<pre>Hello David,

Qigong is a good practice to take up although the
exercises in the first step of IIH are often a missing
ingredient in qigong training. I would say keep them
up and dive deeply into the question of wanting to be
in the body. In the meantime... 
Do you get enough aerobic type exercise? Do you do
any physical work or tiring workouts? That can make
your sleep deeper so that you are more rested in your
sleep. If not I suggest something that is more
physically demanding to complement qigong. Not that
qigong can't be physically demanding. Try Matt Furey's
basic workout. Its called combat conditioning. 
Try looking into whether through some sort of movement
exercises if you can get beginning experiences of
awareness as something that is from the whole body not
just predominently in the head. There is a wonderful
sense of well being in that.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi, I have an issue that has me a bit stumped. I've
&gt; been trying to 
&gt; study this from various angles, but I am at the
&gt; point where some 
&gt; input from others might be helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; In the mental arena, I'm at the very first level of
&gt; Step One. I 
&gt; find that I can follow what happens in my mind
&gt; fairly easily. 
&gt; However, what happens in my mind tends to remain
&gt; somewhat agitated 
&gt; or fast, rather than the &quot;slow thoughts&quot; Rawn
&gt; described somewhere. 
&gt; When it does slow down, I start to drift into a
&gt; brain-fog state of 
&gt; semi-sleepiness.
&gt; 
&gt; When I delved into this further, I became aware that
&gt; for much of my 
&gt; life my physical body has been fairly depleted of
&gt; energy. In order 
&gt; to compensate for constant lack of sleep (caused by
&gt; early school 
&gt; hours and poor diet, I suspect), I learned to
&gt; develop a constant 
&gt; level of mental and physical tension in order to
&gt; stay awake. It's 
&gt; like gradually squeezing a sponge more and more
&gt; tightly to get more 
&gt; water out of it.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem, of course, is that now that I am
&gt; learning to relax my 
&gt; mind, the sleepiness is surfacing. It seems simple
&gt; at first -- get 
&gt; more sleep! However, I am not convinced it is
&gt; entirely about sleep, 
&gt; as I've gotten plenty of sleep over the past few
&gt; days and the 
&gt; sleepiness still lingers. There was another period
&gt; a few years ago 
&gt; when I was sleeping a *lot* every day, and my body
&gt; felt relaxed and 
&gt; heavy when I woke up, but paradoxically I would
&gt; often be almost as 
&gt; sleepy as when I went to sleep. What I have been
&gt; experiencing 
&gt; recently feels similar.
&gt; 
&gt; It could be an issue of vital-energy; I'm
&gt; considering taking up some 
&gt; energy-building practice like qigong to build that
&gt; up.
&gt; 
&gt; There are some emotional issues involved, but I am
&gt; sort of confused, 
&gt; since they seem like chicken-or-egg things. For
&gt; instance, one issue 
&gt; I have is that I dislike fully inhabiting my body. 
&gt; But do I dislike 
&gt; being in my body because I have so little energy and
&gt; therefore it is 
&gt; difficult to use it well, or do I have difficulty
&gt; using it well 
&gt; because I dislike it?
&gt; 
&gt; So I guess I have two basic questions:
&gt; 
&gt; (1) Generally, what are people's perspectives on my
&gt; problem, and do 
&gt; you have any advice?
&gt; 
&gt; (2) Regarding the thought control meditation in IIH:
&gt; I feel as if I 
&gt; am certainly &quot;participating&quot; on some level, but I am
&gt; essentially 
&gt; able to watch my thoughts whiz by without doing
&gt; anything about 
&gt; them. I can watch myself tense up or skip among
&gt; different 
&gt; thoughts. Sometimes my mind settles down only to
&gt; speed back up 
&gt; again. I *think* I'm meeting the goal Bardon
&gt; described, but I am 
&gt; not sure about the quality of my results, ie my mind
&gt; doesn't seem 
&gt; entirely relaxed so might I be doing something
&gt; wrong? I am 
&gt; evidently participating to the extent that I tense
&gt; up to keep myself 
&gt; awake, but if I am aware, in a detached way, of this
&gt; habitual mental 
&gt; *reflex*, does that qualify as a distraction? And,
&gt; more generally, 
&gt; should I be setting the mental work aside until I
&gt; regain the ability 
&gt; to relax mentally without falling asleep, or should
&gt; I proceed, 
&gt; or ... ?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your help.
&gt;
