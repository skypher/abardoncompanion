<pre>I wonder why so many people struggle about food loading. It's something very 
natural.
Think of a mother making a cake for her child. While she's making it, she 
radiates her love for her child. She bring the best of her into this cooking. 
She have beautiful thoughts about her child. This is natural loading. While the 
child will eat the cake, he'll also &quot;eat&quot; the energy filling the cake, ie the 
mental and emotionnal energy the mother has put into the cooking.
Think also at some restaurant where cookers just talk about negativity and 
bring no conscience, attention into what they do... you have a very &quot;poor&quot; food.
To load, consider food as a recipient you can fill with thoughts and emotions. 
For exemple, think of the &quot;history&quot; of some food you have to eat. Think : who 
make this food ? Imagine the making of this food. Thanks the people involved in 
the making. How the universe participate in the making of this food ? Can you 
imagine the amount of energy, the plants that has to grow... so that you can 
eat ? Think about that, and thanks, sincerely. This way, you bring your energy 
into this food, you fill it with gratitude, and the food will act as a &quot;friend&quot; 
to you.
Some people repat a phrase, or a song while making the food to mix the energy 
carried out by the song/sentence with the food.
You can also program the food : just say, and feel the energy, the meaning of 
what you say &quot;i ask that this food, when inside of me, do and blabla&quot; and 
repeat it, slowly, insisting on the meaning of what you say, and with 
conviction.
I read, i think it was in a Sanaya Roman book : if you don't know how to 
magnetise, juste do as if you know how to do. Sometime it works.
It's very easy, and a natural process. When you try to conceptualise too much 
about it, it becomes very hard. It's like walking : everybody know how to walk. 
But you can write thousands of pages about the theory of walking : and then, 
nobody will be able to walk by just reading those theories...
Hope it helps.
