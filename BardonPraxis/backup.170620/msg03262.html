Why would it be a fisheye effect as opposed to something else? What 
I initially want to know is why does it happen one way and not 
another. Why specifically this fisheye effect. I was talking with a 
friend and I was describing an unintentional OBE a long while ago and 
it had this effect and she blurted out Fisheye effect because she 
experienced it, too. Two people experiencing the same effect just 
made me wonder &quot;why it should be this way at all?&quot; Forgive me, but I 
am going to be asking a lot of questions that I can only objectively 
perceive as mind numbing but the only thing that I can convince 
myself of being true in the bardon system without any doubt is the 
polarity of the two elements of Fire and Water. The Akasha, even 
theoretically based I am still struggling with because of this 
neoplatonist idea of emanations that I can't fully grasp as true. I 
am trying to move past faith. What is really going to be 
disheartening is if the answer is dependent on Bardonic dogma. 
(reminds me of an essay I read on the concept of Good, and the 
concept cant be divided into something smaller with other words. 
Unlike the concept of cogitation which can be subdivided further. 
Good has to be experienced like Salt to truly know its nature.) I am 
not interested in discussing techneques of OBEs but why it should BE 
at all (without the dogma if possible). I am trying to make this 
mine eventually.

hee hee. Heres a thought, maybe I should put that out of my mind for 
the time being because it isn't relevant to my situation. Like a 
Buddhist not having a need for God because God's existence isnt 
relevant to the infant-like state we are in. :-)

thanks for your time

&gt; Dear Louis (and Mark),
&gt; 
&gt; If you wish to discuss the techniques presented by Robert Bruce, 
then I
&gt; ask that you submit your questions to one of the Astral Pulse 
discussion
&gt; groups. :)
&gt; 
&gt; In regard to Bardon's system, such a phenomenon is indicative of a 
lack
&gt; of mental (and quite possibly, even astral) Equilibrium of the 
Elements.
&gt; In Bardon's system, this sort of phenomena does not occur since by 
the
&gt; time the student reaches Step Nine and begins astral wandering, 
both the
&gt; astral and mental Equilibriums are well established.
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of phenomena having to do with vision, the Elemental
&gt; imbalance would naturally pertain to the Fire Element.
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
