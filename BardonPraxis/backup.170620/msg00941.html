<pre>Dear Friends,

This update has three main areas.

#1) ABardonCompanion.com enters the eBook Age! ;-) I was recently
introduced to the eBook format by a kind fellow who sent me copies of
the &quot;Center of Stillness&quot; and &quot;Self-Healing Archaeous&quot; articles, which
he'd converted to .LIT Microsoft Reader format. Since this is such a
popular format and since it creates a really quite reader-friendly
product, I decided to convert all but the most complex materials on my
website into this format for downloading. 15 files which were available
for download only in .PDF format are now available in .LIT as well.
Other, more complex, files will be added as time permits.

The introduction of this new format necessitated transforming the old
&quot;Downloadable .PDF Files&quot; page into the new &quot;Downloadable .PDF &amp; eBook
Files&quot; page. :) <a  href="../PDF-Links.html">http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/PDF-Links.html</a>

If you don't already have the *free* Microsoft Reader or Adobe Reader
software, you will find links on the page for acquiring them.

#2) I've posted downloadable text versions of the scripts I used in
making the &quot;Center of Stillness&quot; and &quot;Self-Healing Archaeous&quot; audio
recordings! These are available for download in both .PDF and .LIT
(Microsoft Reader eBook) formats for your convenience and can be found
at <a  href="../PDF-Links.html">http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/PDF-Links.html</a>

What inspired me was a note from a fellow in Portugal saying that he was
having some difficulty in understanding my spoken English. So I sent
him a text version of the original script and, sure enough, reading
along while listening to the recording has greatly improved his
comprehension. Since a very large percentage of visitors to
ABardonCompanion.com are not native English speakers, I decided that it
was a good idea to offer these scripts to everyone. :)

Unfortunately, the digital scripts for &quot;The Magic of IHVH-ADNI&quot; series
have been lost. Eventually, I will create transcriptions of the
hardcopies of these scripts, but this will take some time to accomplish.

#3) And of course, there's a bunch of new excerpts from my
correspondence to be found at
<a  href="http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/Essays&amp;CorrespLinks.html">http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/Essays&amp;CorrespLinks.html</a> There are 11
in total but three of them deserve special mention.

* &quot;Gems of Akasha&quot; by EMC.
This is a really lovely piece by EMC which was posted recently to
the BardonPraxis discussion group. Here, EMC presents a very useable
and practical technique in the Eucharistic Magic vein. As always, his
description is very clear and engaging. :)

* An Exercise In the Direct Perception of Essential Meaning
I write a lot about this subject of Direct Perception but here,
for the first time, I present an easy and very practical exercise for
developing this ability. At the end of my description of the exercise,
I've included excerpts from a discussion that transpired on the
BardonPraxis board. This discussion is important in that it reveals one
person's process of employing the exercise and then achieving a
breakthrough in Direct Perception because of it. :)

* The Magic of IHVH-ADNI -- A Personal Experience Shared
For some time now, I've been working closely with one of my
Companions as he learns The Magic of IHVH-ADNI (TMO) from the recorded
Lessons. Recently he wrote to me with a beautiful and detailed
description of his own personal experience of TMO. I was so impressed
with how clearly he articulated his experience and also, by the quality
and depth of the experience he was describing, that I asked his
permission to share it here for the benefit of others. He happily
consented, so here is his personal description of his experience of TMO,
having completed Lesson Three of the audio series, and then my own
comments (which he asked for).

The other excerpts included in this update are:

* Sensory Concentration: Re-creating Pain
* Gauging the Elemental Balance In Preparation for Step Three
* Sensory Concentration: Remembering - vs. - Creating
* Deepening EOM: Encountering the Different Layers of Mind
* Concerning the &quot;Depth Point&quot;
* Fluid Condensers and the &quot;Influence Through the Elements&quot; Technique
* Cleansing an Object of Negative Energies
* A Question of Omniscience

My best to you all,
:) Rawn Clark
