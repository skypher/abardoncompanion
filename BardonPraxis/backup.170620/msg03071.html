<pre>Hello Robert
All of the advice given so far in response to your question seems 
good to me, however I would also add:
Coming off alcohol is mostly an extremely traumatic and in some 
cases, life-threatening ordeal. Long-term heavy drinkers are best 
advised to seek professional help, and may have to stop or reduce 
their intake under close clinical supervision. Without any more 
details to hand I don't know your friends situation well enough to 
add more than this. If in doubt, he needs to consult with a doctor or 
specialist centre as well as applying some/all of the good advice 
given in earlier emails.

As a further word of advice I would like to add that helping an 
alcohol addict along their path of recovery can be a most traumatic 
and draining experience for the person trying to help. This is 
because long-term heavy use of alcohol distorts the psychology as 
well as the physiology of the sufferer. To the onlooker, the 
behaviour is perplexing, frustrating and extremely demending to say 
the least. Strong boundaries and sheer nerves of steel are called 
for, otherwise you could be in for a very unpleasant ride! Through no 
fault of his own, your friend is likely to put you through a real 
emotional mangle if you allow him to.

Hope this advice does not seem to harsh or patronising - just the 
experience of someone who works with this issue professionally.

Best wishes, Tim

&gt; Dear group,
&gt; I have a very good friend that asked me to help him with 
overcoming his alcoholism.
&gt; 
&gt; That is one thing that I have not had any dealings with and so I 
am relatively ignorant in.
&gt; 
&gt; Is their any of the Bardon material that is directed towards 
healing addictions that you can refer me to ?
&gt; 
&gt; He is the most interesting and exocentric person I know to say 
the least, but has a very good heart and has asked for help.
&gt; He is an inventor and the last thing he invented was an Iron and 
Aluminum alloy. The stress of getting his projects off and working 
leaned him to drinking too much boos and of course he always thought 
(early on) he could back out without any help.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe He has some more good thing to do before he leaves this 
realm and hope that divine provenance will have it.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely, Robert 
&gt; 
&gt;
