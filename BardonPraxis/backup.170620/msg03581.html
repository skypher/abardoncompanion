Dear Rawn,

Thank you for that list. Is the database you mentioned searchable by 
topic? I think that would have been especially useful in step 6. 
Still, the statementes are better topics for meditation than they are 
definitions of akasha. For example, what exactly does it mean to be 
spaceless and timeless? Can anyone imagine such a state?

There are also some internal inconsistencies with the statements. For 
example, in the last sentence of item #7, Bardon is apparently 
referring to the astral plane as spaceless and timeless, yet that is 
the definition of akasha.
In KTQ, bardon talks about akasha, the mental plane (causal in most 
vernacular.), and the astral plane. The difference between them is 
that akasha is spaceless and timeless, the next region includes 
space, and farther down you also get time. It's important to keep 
these distinctions in mind, otherwise, it's easy to get lost.

Bardon gave the world a lot. Unfortunately, he didn't give us 
everything. Part of the path to becomming an &quot;initiate&quot; is to 
decipher the meaning of some of this cryptic material.

With respect to &quot;akasha,&quot; the single best definition I've heard is 
that it is simply the &quot;mind of god.&quot; Perhaps this is not immediately 
comprehensible either, but it is also a good topic for meditation.

Thanks again for that list.

respectfully, 

Frater QV

&gt; Dear 'FraterQV',
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Bardon never really gave a good definition of what &quot;akasha&quot; is.
&gt; There are several different meanings depending on which 
mystical/magical
&gt; school you are talking about. If anyone can quote Bardon's
&gt; comments/definition on &quot;akasha,&quot; I would really love to hear it. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Okay. :) Bardon actually wrote quite a bit about the Akasha and 
thanks
&gt; to the digital versions of his works that are available (except for
&gt; &quot;Questions and Answers&quot;), here are all of his most relevant comments
&gt; describing the Akasha:
&gt; 
&gt; From &quot;Initiation Into Hermetics&quot; --
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Several times while describing the elements I have said that 
they
&gt; proceed from the ethereal principle. Accordingly, the ethereal 
principle
&gt; is the ultimate, the supreme, the most powerful thing, something
&gt; inconceivable, the ultimate cause of all things existing and 
created. To
&gt; put it in a nutshell, it is the causal sphere. Therefore akasa is
&gt; spaceless and timeless. It is the non-created, the 
incomprehensible, the
&gt; indefinable. The various religions have given it the name of God. 
It is
&gt; the fifth power, the original power. Everything has been created by 
it
&gt; and is kept in balance by it. It is the origin and the purity of all
&gt; thoughts and intentions, it is the causal world wherein the whole
&gt; creation in subsisting on, beginning from the highest spheres down 
to
&gt; the lowest ones. It is the quintessence of the alchemists; it is 
all in
&gt; all.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Now the question will arise were and how akasa or the etheric
&gt; principle occurs in the grossly material body. In doing some deeper
&gt; thinking, everybody will be able to answer this question by 
himself, for
&gt; the etheric principle is hidden in its most grossly material form 
in the
&gt; blood and in the seed and in the reciprocal action of these two
&gt; substances in the vital matter or in the vitality.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 3) The material world has emerged from the principle of akasa, 
i.e.,
&gt; the known ether. The world also is controlled and kept by this same
&gt; principle.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Through subtler vibrations of the elements, through the 
electric and
&gt; the magnetic fluid of their polarity, the man proper, the soul has
&gt; proceeded from the akasa principle or the finer etheric vibrations.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 5) The centre of the ether or principle of akasa is found in the 
region
&gt; of the neck and is named Visudha.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 6) Beginning at the top, from the supreme centre, along the neck, 
down
&gt; to the lowest centre, like a channel runs the socalled Susumna or 
the
&gt; akasa-principle already known to us, liable for the connection and
&gt; control of the entire centres.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 7) The astral plane, often designated as the fourth dimension, has 
not
&gt; been created out of the four elements, but it is a density-degree 
of the
&gt; akasa principle, consequently of all that up to now, in the material
&gt; world occurred, is actually occurring and will occur, and has its
&gt; origin, regulation and existence. As said before, akasa in its most
&gt; subtle form is the ether, well known to all of us, in which, amongst
&gt; other vibrations, electric as well as magnetic ones are propagating.
&gt; Consequently this vibration-sphere is the origin of light, sound, 
colour
&gt; , rhythm, and life in all things created. As akasa is the origin of 
all
&gt; existing things, all that ever was produced, is being produced and 
will
&gt; be produced in the future is reflected in it. Therefore, in the 
astral
&gt; plane there is to be seen an emanation of the eternal, having 
neither a
&gt; beginning nor an end, as it is timeless and spaceless.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 8) From the supreme prototype (akasa), the original source of all
&gt; beings, has proceeded the spirit, the spiritual EGO with the four
&gt; specific elemental qualities, proper to the immortal spirit, which 
was
&gt; created in God's image.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 9) All the other qualities of the spirit are based upon these four
&gt; original principles. The typical part of the fifth, say the etheric
&gt; principle (akasa) manifests itself, in the highest aspect, in the 
faith
&gt; and, in the lowest form, in the instinct of self-preservation.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 10) Both these spheres, the material as well as the astral one have
&gt; been born from the akasa or original principle of the respective 
sphere,
&gt; through the four elements, and also the mental sphere is built upon 
the
&gt; same foundation, and therefore likewise a product of the akasa 
principle
&gt; of the spirit. Similar to the spirit, developing in a fourpole 
magnet by
&gt; corresponding work and showing an electromagnetic fluid analogous 
to
&gt; the astral body, on account of the effect of the elements, as a
&gt; secondary phenomenon of the polarity on the outside, the mental body
&gt; develops in the mental or spiritual sphere. Just in the same way as 
the
&gt; astral body, through the electromagnetic fluid of the astral world,
&gt; forms an astral matrix, the so-called astral od, the electromagnetic
&gt; fluid of the mental world forms a mental matrix linking the mental 
body
&gt; to the astral body. This mental matrix or the mental od, the so-
called
&gt; mental substance, is the subtlest form of akasa which controls and
&gt; preserves the spiritual activity in the astral body.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 11) Simultaneously, the mental sphere is the sphere of thoughts 
which
&gt; have their origin in the world of ideas, consequently in the 
spiritual
&gt; akasa. Each thought is preceded by a basic idea which, according to 
its
&gt; property, accepts a definite form, and arrives to the consciousness 
of
&gt; the ego through the etheric principle, consequently the mental 
matrix,
&gt; as expression of the thought in the shape of a plastic picture.
&gt; Therefore Man himself is not the founder of the thoughts, but the 
origin
&gt; of each thought is to be sought in the supreme akasa sphere or the
&gt; mental plane.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 12) Working in the akasa principle is timeless and spaceless; in 
the
&gt; mental sphere, you operate with time; in the astral sphere, you work
&gt; with space (shape, colour); in the material world, you work with 
time
&gt; and space simultaneously.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 13) Consciousness knows neither time nor space; it is consequently 
an
&gt; akasa-principle.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 14) This mental balance is the specific fundamental property of the
&gt; akasa or causal principle of the mind.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 15) Working through this step the scholar should be able to 
transfer
&gt; himself at any hour and in every situation into this depthpoint, 
into
&gt; the akasa principle, from there perceiving and influencing all that
&gt; concerns his being. This consciousness transference into the akasa
&gt; principle is the genuine magical state of trance and represents the
&gt; preliminary stage of the connection with the cosmic consciousness.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 16) We have heard that akasa is the primary source, the sphere of 
all
&gt; causes. Any deliberate cause, such as a wish, a thought, any 
imagination
&gt; created in this sphere together with the dynamic conviction is 
bound to
&gt; be realized with the help of the elements, regardless of the level 
or
&gt; sphere on which the realization necessarily has to be performed. 
This is
&gt; one of the greatest magic mysteries and a universal key for the
&gt; magician, who will understand its range only later on in the course 
of
&gt; his development. The scholar should always keep his mind on his own
&gt; ethical development, which will certainly help him to do only good 
and
&gt; noble deeds. Our next exercise will be to win absolute control of 
the
&gt; elements with the help of the akasa principle in all the three 
realms.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 17) The akasa principle, in its simplest form expresses itself as
&gt; conscience.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 18)
&gt; Element: Fire Air Water Earth Akasa
&gt; Sense: Eyes Ears Perception Taste/Smell All in all
&gt; Quality: Will Intellect Feeling Consciousness Conscience
&gt; Exercise: Optic Acoustic Emotional Expand consc. Realization
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 19) Now load your right hand with akasa, which you imagine to be 
of a
&gt; black- violet colour.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 20) A magician has got to be kind, obliging and willing to help at 
any
&gt; time, to assist by word and deed, to act generously, considerately 
and
&gt; discretely. He must be free from ambition, superciliousness and 
avoid
&gt; any boasting. All such passions would be reflected in the akasa 
and, the
&gt; akasa principle being analogous to harmony, akasa itself would 
certainly
&gt; put the greatest obstacles in the magician's way to stop his further
&gt; development, if not make it quite impossible. Any further rising in 
a
&gt; case like that would be quite out of question. Just remember 
Bulwer's
&gt; novel Zanoni, in which the guardian of the threshold, nothing else 
but
&gt; akasa, sees that the highest mysteries do not come overnight to 
unworthy
&gt; people. Akasa will derange a person mentally, arouse doubts of all
&gt; kinds, or hold him prisoner by vicissitudes and reverses of fortune 
in
&gt; order to protect the mysteries in every possible way. These 
mysteries
&gt; will always remain hidden from incompetent persons, though hundreds 
of
&gt; books should be published about them.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 21) Since the akasa principle ignores time and space, acting
&gt; permanently in the present time, for the concept of time depends on 
our
&gt; senses, the magician is advised to adapt himself as much as 
possible to
&gt; akasa. He must acknowledge the great moment of NOW as 
representative,
&gt; thinking and acting according to it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; From &quot;Key to the True Quabbalah&quot; --
&gt; 
&gt; 22) The sun in the center of the picture represents Divine 
Providence,
&gt; the Akasa Principle, the origin of all that exists.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 23) The &quot;Ch&quot; has a violet color oscillation and thus appertains to 
the
&gt; akasa principle
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 24) The &quot;E&quot;, in a dark violet color, akasa violet, light 
oscillation.
&gt; The &quot;E&quot; has the specific characteristic of the akasa principle 
which is
&gt; revealed, in its elemental effect, in a feeling of power of 
penetrating
&gt; all.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 25) This number is graphically symbolized by a triangle. The three 
is
&gt; the number of akasa principle, of fate, of karma, and, planetarily 
seen,
&gt; the three is attributed to the sphere of Saturn. Everything that 
was,
&gt; that is and that will be, the mental as well as the astral and the
&gt; material, originates from the akasa principle, wherein the three is 
also
&gt; to be found. Number three is the original idea of procreation, which
&gt; manifests itself in the plus and the minus, i.e., in man and woman 
who,
&gt; in unification, beget the third, i.e., the child. In man himself, 
the
&gt; three is represented by spirit, soul and body. The three is also the
&gt; number of intuition. All religious systems, in their fateful
&gt; manifestation, have derived from this number. Three is the number of
&gt; life and death. It is the number of cognition in its highest form.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; From &quot;Practice of Magical Evocation --
&gt; 
&gt; 26) The Akasha Principle of the astral sphere maintains the 
harmonious
&gt; equilibrium of the elements in the entire astral sphere.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 27) The magician also has another opportunity: he can symbolize the
&gt; elements in the circle, in which particular case he only has to 
place
&gt; four lamps inside the magic circle. The magician who stands in the
&gt; center of the magic circle is the representative of the Akasha 
Principle
&gt; and as such he represents the fifth element.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; From &quot;Questions &amp; Answers&quot; --
&gt; 
&gt; 28-54) The last 10 pages (from page 88 onward) are devoted to 
comments
&gt; pertaining to the Akasha.
