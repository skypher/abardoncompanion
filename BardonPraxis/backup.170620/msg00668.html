<pre>Hi Jim,The flu lasts for much longer than 3 days. A cold lasts about 3 days. If 
your get a return of flu-like symptoms every 3 days or so you may be having a 
sinus problem. You may be having allergies or an infection going on. You may 
need to see a doctor. Hope you get to feeling better.

Sometimes a daily practice of Rythmic breathing allows the energy to move 
throughout the aura, thus strengthening the aura and the immune system. The flu 
is related to air because when we catch the flu or cold, it is normally 
transmitted through the air and fluids.

Perhaps Rawn and or others can shed some light on this for all of us?

In L.V.X.

Jim.

M,

&gt;&gt;&gt;I wouldn't be asking, only I felt there might be something to this - first 
of all could this somehow be related to my magic work? Secondly, are there 
any magic exercises that get rid of flu :)?&lt;&lt;&lt;

How can it not be related to your magic work? ;-) 

I used to get the flu at least once every couple months. Now I don't 
remember when the last time was; it has been a very long time. I think that 
the cure is dependent upon the symptoms. Perhaps you could benefit from 
exploring the nature of your symptoms and then devising ways to counter them? 
I think the one-pointedness into vacancy of mind into one-pointedness would 
work well for that. 

I would always experience a &quot;slow&quot; feeling. I can remember having to 
&quot;refresh&quot; myself in some way in order to return to a healthier state. That 
and plenty of rest (sleep even) to allow your unconscious to do more of the 
work that you've been consciously pursuing. I hope you feel better, good 
luck :-)
