<pre>I agree....... thanks for the advice...... I've been calming down 
about the situation now and I see it in a better light....... the 
confrontation will probably still take place... but I'm seeing my 
and his weaknesses and strengths my better than before.... he's the 
type to not show or see weakness in himself, just in others.... 
conceited if you will.... so I can work on my own soul mirror, and 
that will help me far more than just ignoring weaknesses and 
pretending they're not there....... oh by the way, I've actually 
been a member here for like... more than a month, I've got it set up 
so I get the new posts sent to me via email... so I think I read the 
thread you were referring to, I just haven't really had much to post 
about until now cause I had a 'teacher' to talk to about questions 
I've had.... I'm only now realizing that his answers didn't really 
do the questions justice.... so I must now re-analyze the knowledge 
I've acquired from him and use the good for myself and take the bad 
and keep it in storage in my mind, knowing this is how he looks at 
things.......

I've got another question thinking about it...... has anyone here 
ever heard of a feeder? someone who pulls people into their group 
to feed on their energy by manipulating them and their 
addictions/desires....... right now that's the basis for his plans, 
he's been pulling people in, by way of mostly drug addictions (pot, 
pills, and also sexual desires) to feed on them, and he's also 
acquired my best friend through manipulation of his desires........ 
I'm not yet sure how strong my teacher's grip is on him, but I was 
wondering if there's any way to help him to figure it out and choose 
to free himself...... currently my contact with him is severed due 
to the circumstances, but I managed to get a message to him that I 
wanted to talk to him and for him to contact me...... I want to be 
able to help him with this, but without letting on about the 
situation (e.g. my teacher and my confrontation, etc..) to come (for 
fear he might be reporting back)........ any suggestions on this 
particular type of thing would be even more helpful.... it's 
difficult to figure out how to go about things in a tricky situation 
like this........ but I thank you for the advice you've given, I 
think that soul mirror work alone will be incredibly beneficial to 
me in working this out.... I just don't want to see my friend be 
manipulated like this if there's something I can do about it....

&gt; G'day Chuck &amp; Dan,
&gt; 
&gt; So glad you found my suggestions useful! :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We could all be observing in most of our interactions, even in 
the 
&gt; midst of our acting or reacting. Bravo! &lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed. To me, that's the meaning of Step 1, Spirit, Exercise 2a: 
&gt; Giving your full attention to *everything* that you do.
&gt; 
&gt; A friend told me a few years ago about a book she'd read. The 
&gt; author made the point that if we acquire the habit of &quot;giving our 
&gt; full attention to everything we do&quot;, two things happen:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. We become aware of just how much choice we have in every 
moment 
&gt; (eg, &quot;This glass is raising to my lips, because *I choose* for - 
and 
&gt; will - it to happen&quot;);
&gt; 
&gt; 2. We begin to interact with others with *full consciousness*.
&gt; 
&gt; The implication of the first outcome is that we find less reason 
to 
&gt; think of ourselves as &quot;victims&quot;. We begin to see ourselves as 
&gt; Empowered: &quot;Look at how much control I exercise in every moment of 
&gt; my life - I'm not a victim all!&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; The implication of the second is that *we choose* how we behave in 
&gt; every moment, by bringing our emotions under *our* control. No 
&gt; longer do we impulsively reach for the gun in the glove 
compartment 
&gt; when someone cuts us off on the freeway! ;-) ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, Bardon's system of Initiation takes this further by 
&gt; welding the Soul Mirror tools to the Step One, Spirit, 2a exercise.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; See ya,
&gt; 
&gt; Jason
