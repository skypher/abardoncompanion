<pre>Hello Group,

I have done quite a bit of meditation on the subject, and if the 
subject is still cloudy, then at least it is a little less opaque 
than it had been. 

Rawn, I am satisfied with your explanation that front, when referred 
to the occult body, means &quot;most commonly expressed.&quot; I also 
appreciated the link you'd sent me (C:\My Documents\Occult\Bardon 
Correspondence - 87.htm) for explicating the relationship between the 
physical occult body, the astral body, and the mental. 

I still ponder why Bardon would use the terms left and right. The 
best answer I could come up with came from a dream. Please indulge 
me while I quickly describe this dream:

Pondering the subject around midnight, I fell asleep and my dreams 
were filled with visions of the human body and the coursings of the 
electrical and magnetic fluids. I saw a world of three dimensions 
but, curiously, the human body was two-dimensional. This is not 
literally true, perhaps, but it is close to describing what I saw. 
With the occult body, I noted, there could be no relativism of left 
and right because the hand was both left AND right. Right came to 
mean &quot;outer&quot; with regards to the right side of the body and left came 
to mean &quot;inner&quot; with regards to the right side of the body. This was 
reversed, of course, with regards to the left side of the body.

Maybe others out there consider this meaningless? To me, there was a 
great deal of meaning in this dream. Perhaps it is to be personally 
understood by me and no one else? 

I am very curious about the occult body, especially with regards to 
the hands. In my personal magic, I've used my hands as a sort of 
living wand to emanate energy (I know one can do this without using 
hands, but it is a personal preference and not a crutch). I also 
play guitar (baroque and rock) and write fiction, two activities that 
are sacred to me and for which I must, of course, use my hands. 
Hence my interest in discerning meaning in left and right per 
Bardon's anatomy theories.

If anyone has any other thoughts on the subject, I'd appreciate 
hearing them.

Fiat Lux,

Kiyan

&gt; Dear Kiyan,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have questions about the occult anatomy. For some body parts, 
it
&gt; is obvious what is meant by the front and back, or the right and 
left.
&gt; A person's abdomen is a good example. But what about other body 
parts
&gt; where front and back, right and left are not as clearcut or 
objective?
&gt; &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; These terms cannot be understood in their normal, spatial sense 
since
&gt; they refer to the *astral* Fluids and are used symbolically. For 
example
&gt; &quot;front&quot; in this context, means &quot;most commonly expressed&quot;. You might
&gt; find reading the following page helpful
