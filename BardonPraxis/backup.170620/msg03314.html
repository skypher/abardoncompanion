<pre>Hello Chuck, when I said

&gt;&gt;&quot;My only other comment on the whole process so far is that the 
mental helps with the astral. As in, once you get good at Thought 
Discipline you can meditate on the tetragrammaton itself and its 
significance, and then be constantly aware, ...&quot;&lt;&lt;
all I meant was, and unlike what a cursory read of IIH seemed to say to me 
at 1st anyhow, Thought Discipline (step 1 mental ex 2) is really about being 
able to think very clearly and deeply without deviating - but it still is 
thinking, a *chain* of thoughts, not stopping them. If you ever write well and 
really concentrate on what you actually mean it's just the same - but the paper 
is your mind, and instead of grabbing thoughts from a stream you watch the 
whole stream carefully, or that's how it's starting to seem to me, but I'm not 
expert yet I wouldn't say. So I use that to dig into the 4 elements and kind 
of watch them working in a general way. Why would someone say something so 
bizarre as that the universe comes down to them? This took me a while and I 
still haven't got it, but it's like there's a logic to them. They fit together 
and complement each other.

So once you see that in principle you start to notice it in practice on alot 
of levels, or that's what I found. You can almost watch that overbalancing 
on a positive element going to the negative in terms of mood - in a 
conversation for example, too much enthusiasm giving way to irritation, too 
much 
sympathy and compassion turning into depression, too much lighthearted banter 
turning into mischief, too much weight and gravitas becoming locked into dogma, 
etc 
etc for example. So you feel a way you can walk forward without toppling and 
in doing so you are using the other side of that same exercise, the one 
where you stay aware all day. I mean, I give social examples but they don't 
have 
to be of course. You stay focussed on whatever it is and notice what your 
natural reaction is.

Sorry to run on. Never ask *me* to 'elaborate', unless you really, like, 
*mean* it!

You said: 



&gt;&gt;Think of it, nobody has 
any of the same situation in their early growing years. We may all 
have one parent, two parents, but we have a different family friend 
who always has an impact on us for instance.&lt;&lt;

... and I think you're spot on there. I think family is something magic 
doesn't usually touch on but it's really interesting and I do think about it 
alot. Not only all the usual stuff about early experiences (I do think some 
Freudian ideas have something to them now, which I never did before - who would 
have thought *magic* would do that??) but also, as bardon himself said, the 
Akasha in its 'coarsest form' lies in the blood and semen (or egg). There is a 
strong tie to me of fate in family, in everything to do with sex. It makes 
sense to me as a male, looking at how one behaves at puberty when all the stuff 
comes flooding in. One could say that's when certain karmic burdens start 
functioning, I'm just speculating here I don't know for sure.

Anyway the thing is the Hermetic approach allows you to see it. I don't 
really think you need spend alot of time reliving the past deliberately, but 
you 
do kind of need to know if you're doing it subconsciously! Who was it who said 
that the things we fear most have already happened to us? Anyhow, praise to 
Bardon because his course is a thing of beauty. Sometimes when I first read 
it it seemed almost thrown together, but as it turns out it's really 
incredibly precisely engineered and that's why it delivers, so I'd say.

Best wishes, Jason
