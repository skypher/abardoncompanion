<pre>Dear Philippe,

&gt;&gt; But then I have been thinking about it and must admit that, in fact,
I have been able to &quot;feel&quot; an answer to many questions by going through
your site (and other material) and meditating about it (.taking my time.
We/I will benefit much more by having devoting more time to new material
for your website... but of course you already knew that... &lt;&lt;

:) What I also know from personal experience is that students of
initiation benefit most from developing their own power of self-reliance
and their own faculties of self-discovery. The habit of relying upon
others for answers to our questions breeds a weakening dependence that
is counter-productive to the process of initiation. It deflates our
inherent power to figure things out for ourselves through personal
effort and personal experience.

&gt;&gt; There is no mention of common rituals like LBRP in IIH, as is also
the case on your website. I actually remember reading a comment from you
that Bardon mentioned that practicing rituals that are not &quot;understood&quot;
was in fact sorcery. &lt;&lt;

I believe what I said is that practicing rituals one doesn't understand
fits with Bardon's definition of sorcery, not that Bardon himself stated
such a thing. :) Also, you will find some specific rituals on my
website, The Magic of IHVH-ADNI being primary among them, but in each
case I do my best to first introduce the reader to their meaning so that
there is no lack of understanding in their performance.

You are correct that in IIH Bardon did not mention any rituals like the
LBRP. What he did do however, was provide the student all the necessary
tools to create their own, self-designed rituals (e.g., the section on
finger rituals). True magic is a spontaneous act that arises from
internal knowledge based upon personal experience and that is what IIH
teaches. LBRP on the other hand is not spontaneous, self-designed or
rooted in internal knowledge derived from personal experience. Instead,
it is dogmatic and is the product of another's experience and knowledge.

&gt;&gt; However, I have read the book by Alexandre Moryason &quot;La Lumi&#xE8;re sur
la Royaume&quot; (in French, my native language), and he specifically
recommends the practice of LBRP and other Golden Dawn inspired rituals
as an essential aid to IIH. What should I make of it ? &lt;&lt;

What you make of it is, of course up to you. :) I personally strongly
disagree with Moryason on this point. In fact, I believe such practices
are counter-productive to the pursuit of IIH. If they were *essential*
as Moryason asserts then undoubtedly Bardon would have said so in IIH.

&gt;&gt; I am also disturbed by the fact that various authors (Regardie,
Kraig, Moryason.) seem to propose different versions of LBRP (going
first on right or left shoulder, names/pronunciation). If these rituals
are indeed powerful, then such details should not be indifferent - but
then which one is &quot;right&quot;? &lt;&lt;

The *only* thing that makes such a ritual powerful is its personal
significance to the practitioner. The ritual itself has no intrinsic
power. In other words, if someone who gave the ritual no significance
whatsoever was to practice it there would be absolutely no effect.
Significance is something the *practitioner* must bring to and give to
the ritual in order for it to be at all effective. Obviously then, an
author will propose the version that they personally have deemed most
significant for *them*, hence the differences you've noted. In the end,
none are *universally* &quot;right&quot; while each is *personally* &quot;right&quot; for
the one proposing it. The question then becomes which is *personally*
&quot;right&quot; for *you*?

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
