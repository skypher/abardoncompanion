<pre>Hello,

Now, I am confused. :) From what I understand from Bardon's book in 
the Emptiness of Mind, is that I should resist with all my strength 
from thoughts are coming in. I think there is a line where it is 
stated somethign like that. Rawn, did I understand Bardon 
correctly? 

But from Pedro's perspective is I have to let the thoughts just come 
in. Although not attached to it. But seemingly Pedro attach a 
special meaning to the thoughts coming in. as this line:

&gt; Your thoughts will become more &quot;meaningful&quot; as you progress in the 
&gt; study.

&gt;From my perspective, maybe I am doing a similar thing with what Pedro 
is saying but not entirely similar. Whenever a thought arises, I 
just shift my focus out of it by not thinking of it - &quot;not attached 
to it&quot;. And later on the thought just disappear because no thinking 
process is being given to it. And of course, another thought will 
come in, and I just do it again. Shifting my focus out. But by doing 
this, I don't care about the thoughts coming in. So I don't think 
even meaningful thoughts will come in. Because I shift out of the 
thoughts everytime.

And just a question too, is there a maximum length to be devoted to 
the Emptiness of Mind exercise everyday (like 30 minutes?)? 

Paul, how do you practise it in the office?

Thanks,
Geoffrey

&gt; Hi Geoffrey, 
&gt; 
&gt; This is unsolicited , with all due respect to all, I'd just like to 
&gt; add a little something. Just let it happen. From what I have 
learned, 
&gt; the idea of learning to &quot;let go&quot; of your thoughts is for us to 
learn 
&gt; not to end up forcing concepts and ideas into the practice to be 
able 
&gt; to get results. That was why he said &quot;to be a silent observer&quot;. 
This 
&gt; is a natural tendency of a person in the study - to be expecting 
the 
&gt; results or effects of the practice. At this early stage, the 
student 
&gt; is likely to simulate experiences where later on in the study it 
&gt; might be the cause of a stagnation. I fell into the trap before 
when 
&gt; I was so eager to get results and be able to say something to my 
&gt; guide. 
&gt; 
&gt; Your thoughts will become more &quot;meaningful&quot; as you progress in the 
&gt; study.
&gt; 
&gt; During this stage, just learn to focus and extend the duration of 
&gt; this focus. Breathing properly is of utmost importance.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope I worded it properly that you got my point and that I was 
able 
&gt; to help you in any way.

&gt; &gt; Thanks Rawn,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regarding the one pointedness after I return from emptiness, what 
I 
&gt; &gt; focus upon? should I focus upon the period I went into emptiness 
&gt; in 
&gt; &gt; the sense that the blank there will become meaningful thoughts? 
&gt; Did I get it right?
&gt; &gt;
