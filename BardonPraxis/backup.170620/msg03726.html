<pre>Dear 'aha3996',

&gt;&gt; In my reading over the years, many authors insist that one must have
a personal teacher/&quot;guru&quot; in order to progress along the path. Others
advocate that one needs to be linked to an order, via initiation, that
has a lineage back to the original source of the mysteries. Rene Guenon
advocates this position and then proceeds to tell the reader that at
the present he knows of no genuine initiatory groups other than the
shadow of them found in various existing groups of freemasonry. Franz
Bardon seems to take the opposite view of not being bound by any oath or
to any group or person with the alternative of following the path on
your own. Any input out there on these divergent opinions? &lt;&lt;

There are several factors here, foremost of which is that these authors
were likely taught by others to think that way. Other factors are that
they were/are likely involved in a group, involved with a specific
teacher/guru or are themselves looking for students and thus have a
vested self-interest in others thinking as they do that a
teacher/guru/group is *required*.

Also, there are traditions and lineages of practice and dogma that do
indeed *require* a personal teacher to learn since they are passed along
only in that way or are so complex that they are impossible to learn on
one's own.

Bardon's statements about obligating oneself by oath to a teacher or
group came from his own personal experience of groups and teachers. His
point however had little to do with dogmatic tradition but rather,
pertained specifically to the essential *process* of Hermetic initiation
itself, stripped of all self-interest and dogma. The system he
presented negates the prior need for such obligations because it
encapsulates the essential work of initiation that, teacher/group or
not, the student themselves must perform for themselves and on their
own. The work he described does not *require* a teacher or group
because it is something no teacher or group can do for you -- it's the
work *you* have to do yourself whether or not a teacher/group is in any
way involved.

And there it is, all written down and it costs nothing more than the
price of the book. And, no oaths or allegiances are required! :) The
only thing required is your own effort . . .

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
