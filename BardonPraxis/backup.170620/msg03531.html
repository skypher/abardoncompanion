<pre>It's like realizing that knee-jerk responses which may have served well
in the past are now just emotional juvenile delinquents. When I'd
realize that I was choosing a response that five minutes later I'd
regret, I'd say to myself &quot;Oh, there you are you
'yell-first-think-later' response! If I use you now, my kids will tune
me out next time and I'll feel guilty as soon as I shut up. I think
I'll just be quiet and think of another response.&quot; One of my early
resistance mechanisms was to think that by exercising self control and
making a different choice that would align w/ my mirror work, others
would think I was wishy-washy and soft. But actually, the amount of
awareness and discipline I had to muster was incredible. And, I found
that I was putting what others thought ahead of my own work - and in
nearly all cases, no one cared anyway! This realization was liberating.



BTW, I still slip, but now I can get over it much more quickly.
Sometimes, I think it's arrogance that keeps many wallowing in how awful
they think they are. I think that was my problem. I was loathe to let
go of being right that I was a horrible person. Because then what? I'd
actually have to be good ;-)

Dear Jerry,

&gt;&gt; I was concerned that many of my negative flaws actually have a
positive contribution to my personality. In other words there is
something valuable in the flaw, a hidden agenda that over the long run
is positive. Perhaps some behaviors are there to teach me to have more
fun, or quit taking things so seriously etc. However the behavior is
still a quality I do not wish to have and is a part of my shadow, so it
will be dealt with in due time. I am looking very carefully at trying to
find what the negative behaviors are trying to teach me about myself,
and perhaps adding in additional positive habits to my white
mirror....purposely developing them in myself, in order to fulfill these
needs. &lt;&lt;

A beneficial way in which to examine your negative Mirror is to consider
that at one time, each negative characteristic began as a response to a
positive need. At the time of origin, most negative characteristics
were *unconscious* and *automatic* responses to that positive need, and
it may, at the time, have been a positive reaction. However, over time
those positive responses became habitual and served your need in a less
and less positive way as you matured, resulting in a *negative* trait
now. But still at their root was an original positive need. Through
self-examination, it is possible to discover whether or not that
original positive need still exists and if it does, then it is also
possible to figure out a *conscious* and *intentional* positive way to
meet that need.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
