<pre>Dear Rawn,
Thanks for your patient advice, I think I understand the concept now.
I won't labour this post with my experiences, but when I practice
perceiving essential meaning, I seem to receive a flash of intuition
that reveals the true 'nature' of that which I am perceiving - with
the Moon I receiving one flash in which I sensed that the Moon has a
very intimate connection with myself (and the rest of earth), though I
didn't seem to perceive the details. The experiences seem to unveil a
kind of vibrant beauty that reappears when I look at the subject again
(without trying to perceive it's e.m.).

On an unrelated note, I have been reading a book to do with Franz
Bardon/Hermetics lately, and the author really labours the point of
how correctly performed pranayama is indespensable to making progress
with IIH - he says it opens the Chakras, but doesn't this happen in
step three? 
All the best,
M

&gt; Dear M,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; You commented in your post that:
&gt; Quote: &quot;Every change in form represents a shift in essential meaning.&quot;
&gt; However, in your article that I referenced to, you stated that:
&gt; Quote: &quot;if you alter the physical form alone, you do not thereby change
&gt; the essential meaning -- all you do then is express it less clearly.&quot;
&gt; Surely these are contradictory statements? I'm not trying to play the
&gt; angry skeptic :) I would just like to understand. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; It sure looks contradictory, doesn't it! :) However, the /DP3.html
&gt; quote was in reference to a *natural* form and my recent remark was in
&gt; reference to a painter's creation (i.e., a human created form).
&gt; 
&gt; If, for example, we pluck one petal from the rose (nature's creation),
&gt; we do not change the rose's essential meaning -- all we have done is mar
&gt; its clarity of expression. However, if the painter decided to repaint
&gt; his red rose, blue, then the essential meaning would be radically
&gt; changed.
&gt; 
&gt; Another way of stating it is that only the creator of a thing can alter
&gt; its essential meaning through an alteration of the physical form.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have come to the (new) conclusion that the various parts of an
&gt; object express a different essential meaning than the object as a whole.
&gt; &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; That's not quite it. Each part expresses an *aspect of* the essential
&gt; meaning of the sum of those parts.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; So the cultural history of the image, and the (intention, accuracy?)
&gt; of the workers who made it can be expressed to me through essential
&gt; meaning irrespective of me having no prior knowledge of them? Sort of
&gt; like a 'psychic perception', i.e. I could sense the cultural
&gt; significance of an African fertility doll despite me initially thinking
&gt; it was some sort of shrunken head used to ward off evil spirits? &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Essentially, yes. Psychometry is rooted in the perception of an
&gt; object's essential meaning, mostly at the astral level which is readily
&gt; influenced by the object's environment. Essential meaning in a physical
&gt; object also manifests astrally and mentally; therefore, the perception
&gt; of a physical object's essential meaning will have those components to
&gt; it as part of the perceptual gestalt. With practice, one can learn to
&gt; focus in on one particular layer of the essential meaning's
&gt; multi-layered expression.
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
