<pre>Hi Rawn,
Just wanted to applaud your comments on defense. The highest form of martial 
arts roots deep in this wisdom.Thank You for putting it so well . In theold 
tradition, character transformation was part of reaching those so called higher 
abilities, but has been put aside because of a lack of understanding. And 
because of this, so to, the real power behind the original intention has been 
lost for most seeking further advancement on this path.
Yours Loyd

That's true !!!! I spent 4 years practicing with blinkers, and now I've been 
practicing with eyes and mind wide-open the all matter is being much easier to 
understand ! Each of the presented exercices can be used in the all-day life. I 
needed 4 years to see that reaching my mind but I never despaired !!!

Dear Devin,

&gt;&gt; First, once we master the observation of thoughts (OOT) and move on
to thought control (TT), are we to *replace* OOT with TT? Or are we to
add on the period of time it takes to do both exercises to our routine?
&lt;&lt;

I think you will find that you're never really done with any of the
techniques that the exercises teach and that each one has its
applications outside of the exercise context. In other words, while you
do replace the OOT *exercise* with the TT exercise once you've mastered
OOT, the OOT becomes a handy tool which you will employ as needed. It
just won't be an *exercise* that you sit down and do for an allotted
amount of time.

&gt;&gt; Likewise, once TT is mastered, do we continue it daily along with the
Emptiness of Mind (EOM) exercise? &lt;&lt;

TT is a VERY handy tool. For example, your meditations about the theory
section or your Soul Mirror issues are all a form of TT (thought
discipline). So its not something you ever really stop, except *as an
exercise*. Also, some folks find it easier to attain EOM if they first
pass through TT.

&gt;&gt; When we reach Step two, do we continue these exercises as well? &lt;&lt;

EOM is to be continued (for life). TT however, is again used as a
*tool* through all the future Steps, but is not an *exercise* in and of
itself. For example the Step Two Sensory Concentration exercises are a
*form of* TT.

&gt;&gt; Also, regarding the impregnating breaths, once our desire is
realized, and we move on to a new one, do we start the exercise over at
the 7 breaths and add one breath each day until our new desire is
realized? &lt;&lt;

After reading your reply to Basim, I suggest that you focus upon the
*time* you spend and not upon the *number* of inhalations.

&gt;&gt; Sorry if this has been answered somewhere else, I couldn't find it if
it has. &lt;&lt;

I suggest that you check out the section of my website which is filled
with excerpts from my public and private correspondence.

Making war on enemies does *not* increase positivity. All that does is
increase and perpetuate the negative. It perpetuates conflict and war
which throughout history has never *solved* anything.

To say that Bardon fought against the &quot;forces of evil&quot; misses the point.
Certainly he protected himself when his life was threatened but he
didn't waste his time fighting against them. Instead, he spent his life
focused upon *increasing positivity* and upon *increasing the light*.

You don't brighten a dark room by stamping out the darkness. Instead,
you do it by turning on a light.

Dear Eric,

&gt;&gt; Well, when I look our 93 Ford, I see rust. It makes me think of
change, but not evolution (granted the chunks of rust found on our
driveway may eventually cycle back into a Form 'more evolved' than one
of 'Henry's better ideas!). &lt;&lt;

This is an excellent example of how much one's perspective plays a part
in their personal definition of change vs. evolution. From your
perspective it's just change because at an emotional level you gain
nothing from the change. However, from the perspective of the iron
which composes the car, there is evolution afoot! ;-)

&gt;&gt; These are the cycles referred to by the astrologers eg: a 'Day of
Brahma', or the 'great ages'? &lt;&lt;

Yes.

Subject: Black Magic

Hello to all!!!!!!

I have a dude: from a &quot;bardonian&quot; :) point of view, is illegitimate 
the use of the so-called black magic under ANY circumstance? For 
example, if a person threats of death to you or tou your family, or 
hurts to your children, can be karmically incorrect for oneself 
making use of it? Is it unethical in every way possible? Can we 
generate a negative karma by omission of help to our family with the 
magic in these cases? (Obviously, I am talking about extreme cases; 
please don&#xB4;t say to me: &quot;hey, call to the police, etc...&quot; Well, 
let&#xB4;s suppose that the police ignores you). I don&#xB4;t know if I have 
explained my dude clearly. I would like to know your opinions.
Well, thank you very much for your attention :)

Dear Rawn,

&gt; This is why I say it would be self-destructive. For example, look 
&gt; where acting upon the scientific model of the physical universe 
&gt; has brought us. I was commenting to a friend just yesterday that, 
&gt; based upon that model, we have replaced streets filled with horse 
&gt; manure, with air filled with carcinogens.

Ah, this fits well with my thoughts - stemming from my conclusion 
regarding the possibility of such a model to only descirbe the 7 
lower spheres - and my worries. You see, I am aware of certain 
research being done into, what seems to me, as this area. They are 
getting some results, limited and not really predictable ones, but 
still results. I fear that just like today the air is polluted and 
mankind has a nuclear arsenal in its possesion, tomorrow will bear 
deliberate contamination and damage to the astral and mental as 
well, due to the exact same lack of understanding and responsibility.
It is my hope that perhaps one day a magician will &quot;oversee&quot; such 
development, perhaps procuring a beneficial technology for the good 
of uninitiated mankind, instead of something destructive.
Thank you for your thoughts and insight :) I think I'll spend some 
more time meditating on it by myself too now, for some reason this 
subject bothers me quite a bit.

Sincerely,
Daniel Gutmanas

Subject: Re: Black Magic

Dear Joa,

As I don't know what kind of threat that person gave you 
(physical, &quot;psychic/magical&quot;, etc - although in the case of a 
supposed &quot;psychic&quot; attack, I think the best response is usually just 
to ignore the threat, and not to get paranoid :) I can't give you a 
specific answer regarding your case, but I do have a general comment 
regarding karma and protection, at least from my point of view;
If I understand you correctly and by &quot;black magic&quot; you mean harming 
the other person in magical ways, there is no need to use &quot;black 
magic&quot; at any point. Instead of harming him, I think it is much 
preferred to neutralize his attack (whether magically or somehow 
else obviously depends on your case and your current abilities) - 
this way, you'll defend yourself and those close to you, you will 
not incur karmic damage, and you might even nudge the attacker 
towards positive change too!
Instead of trying to become the karmatic force for the attacking 
person by punishing him, trust that karma is universal, and he will 
learn his lesson eventually. Instead of focusing on him, focus on 
yourself: shield yourself (and those you wish to protect) from his 
attacks, meditate about your feelings towards him, and strive do be 
your best in this situation.
That's how I see such cases.

Sincerely,
Daniel Gutmanas

It is impossible to *permanently* damage the astral or mental realms.
It is also impossible to *permanently* damage the physical realm as a
whole. The damage we humans have done is limited to our planet and like
all *things*, this too will pass away. The whole of human existence
occurs within the blink of the Divine eye -- we are no where near as
important to the Universe as we like to think. :)

I suggest that in your meditations you try to step back from your
emotional involvement in this fear and take a longer temporal view. The
main thing that matters is what *you* do, *now*, not what others might
do in the future.

My best to you,

From: &quot;Rawn Clark&quot; 
Subject: Re: Black Magic

Dear Joa,

There's a fine internal line between defending yourself and your loved
ones, and getting back at someone who has hurt you. At the core of the
difference is emotional motivation. Reacting out of fear and spite or
to seek revenge, is all about how hurt or afraid *you* feel and has
nothing to do with actual defense or protection. Nor does it have
anything to do with *magic*. In order to perform *magic*, you must step
back from emotional motivation. Granted, emotional investment plays a
part in the power of one's magical effectiveness but only as a *tool*,
not as a core motivation. A true magician is in *command of* their
emotions, not ruled *by* them.

I've had the opportunity to speak and work with several folks who have
been the subject of genuine &quot;psychic attacks&quot; and not a single one of
them had any success by *fighting* their oppressors on the same level at
which their attackers were working. They only succeeded when they
*protected themselves* through the application of higher forms of magic.

And in my own life, when I come under this sort of attack, I never
&quot;fight back&quot; or seek to in any way take revenge through harming the
attacker. Personally, I don't *care* if they learn a lesson or suffer
because of their actions against me. I simply protect myself and
diffuse my attacker. In this way, the attacker is disempowered;
whereas, responding in kind *only* empowers them. That is the nature of
attack -- it thrives upon receiving the fear reaction from its victim.
If the victim refuses to be a victim and does not reply in kind with a
negative action, then the attacker gains nothing and has, in fact, lost
energy.

While personal ethics play a role here, the main issue is what actually
works when you're confronted with an attack. :) For example, if some
one is attacking you with a knife, then obviously you want to disable
them in whatever way you are able. But going further and then trying to
kill them because they had the gall to attack you is another matter
entirely and this is where personal ethics come into play. Defending
yourself is an instinctual necessity but taking revenge is an
emotionally motivated *choice*.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark

Well, I didn&#xB4;t say that I have suffered an attack. I was only exposing a
dude. But I am in TOTAL disagreement with you
when you say that the best response is &quot;to ignore the threat and not to get
paranoid&quot;. Well, I don&#xB4;t believe that
a person that has been threaten of death by a dangerous person (an assasin,
for example) has &quot;paranoia&quot;. He has REALLY
a problem, and to ignore that can put in danger his own life. If you ignore
a problem when you really have a problem, then you are doing the same thing
that the ostrich: to hide your head under the ground.

&quot;Instead of harming him, I think it is much
&gt; preferred to neutralize his attack&quot;

Well, let&#xB4;s suppose that a woman is mistreated by her husband every day,
physically and psychically. She informs on the police her case, but the
police is absolutely negligent with this case (this is something very
frequent in many parts of the world, unfortunately, and many women die).
Well, could you say me what method must employ this woman to &quot;neutralize his
attack&quot;? Sincerely, I haven&#xB4;t got very clear how this woman could defend
herself and those close to her (for example, her children, who, in many
occasions are victims of the domestic violence too). The examples that I
could put to you are innumerable...

&quot;Instead of trying to become the karmatic force for the attacking
&gt; person by punishing him, trust that karma is universal, and he will
&gt; learn his lesson eventually&quot;

Yes, it is very possible that the husband of the woman of the preceding
example, after killing her, eventually will learn that lesson, that karma is
universal.

Like you see, I desagree with you in many points, but in any case, thank you
very much for you attention. ;)
