<pre>Dear Richard,

&gt;&gt; Q. can MS be treated successfully at this time by Hermetic means
(given Group Karma)? &lt;&lt;

In this case, group karma is not an issue.

&gt;&gt; Q. What is the root cause of the illness, and can it protected
against by persons untrained in Hermetics? &lt;&lt;

With most all auto-immune disease processes, the root cause can be found
in the individual's reluctance to be incarnate. Generally, the person
is not consciously aware of their reluctance or, if they are aware of
reluctance, they seldom associate it with the manifestation of
auto-immune disease.

The best protection against an auto-immune disease process is to fully
engage in life, deal head-on with troublesome issues and find productive
ways of de-stressing.

&gt;&gt; Q. Assuming it can be treated by Hermetics, any ideas what form the
treatment would take? &lt;&lt;

Treatment must address the whole person and not just the physical
manifestation. In other words, it must start at the higher levels of
Self and progress downward into the physical body. For the most part,
Hermetic healing is not allopathic as in *just* making an adjustment to
the physical body's structure such as an allopath would do by
prescribing a medication. Instead, true Hermetic healing (or true
healing of any kind) addresses the root astra-mental cause *along with*
the physical symptoms. If the astra-mental cause is not rectified then
the physical symptoms will return even if they have been eliminated
once.

In the TMO Working Group, we have devised a methodology using The Magic
of IHVH-ADNI in which we descend upon our healing subjects with an
accumulation of the Adonai Light, starting from their Greater Self
(their eternal or Akashic mental body), then their Individual Self
(their temporal mental body), then their astral body and finally, their
physical body. Thus the *whole* of the incarnate person is directly
involved in the healing process, not *just* their physical body. While
the results are not as immediately dramatic in terms of their *physical*
symptoms as would, say, taking the latest miracle drug, the effects are
more permanent and life changing.

TMO aside, in terms of Bardonian Hermetic methodology, dealing with MS
would require treating the patient's three bodies simultaneously. The
first step would be to Fluidically balance their mental, astral and
physical bodies, in that sequence. This is done by loading the
appropriate halves of each body with the correct Fluid. Then the
Elemental regions of each body are likewise loaded with the appropriate
Element creating an Elemental *balance* throughout. This would need to
be repeated often in conjunction with counseling which must be focused
upon addressing the patient's unconscious reluctance to be in their
bodies and living their lives. To relieve the immediate symptoms of the
sclerosis, I would suggest applications of the Water and the Air
Elements to the affected areas.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
