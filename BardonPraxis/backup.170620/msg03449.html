<pre>Greetings,

I'm having difficulty understanding the theory (and hence practise) 
behind the Step 1 physical exercise of Breathing. This might be 
reflected in my confused attempt at posing the question - apologies if 
this is the case.

Essentially, the whole planar structure of the Theory section which I'd 
accepted up until this point has now resurfaced to confuse me - it 
seems that this is always the way we notice our ignorance. Firstly, 
here's how I currently (quite probably mis-) understand the Breathing 
task:

I think (a Mental act, it seems) - 'health'
Somehow (qn 1 below) this thought impregnates the air via Akasha (?)
Drawing in this impregnated air (a Physical act) my body absorbs the 
electro-magnetically charged air
This impregnated thought is transmitted through the astral matrix to 
the Soul
&gt;From the Soul, via the mental matrix, to the Spirit.

Qn 1: How can posing a thought (this is a mental act in Bardon terms, 
correct?) impregnate the air external to the body. Or indeed, how can a 
Mental Plane idea impregnate the physical air?

This question suggests an answer to me personally - that of course the 
division between Mental and Physical is on this level a false one - 
that the planes are analogies that aren't to be seen as a separate 
boxes. For example, why is this exercise seen as 'Physical' - it 
appears to be quite encompassing of Mental and Physical (via Astral, 
I'd guess) to me. The mapping of Akasha onto these realms has thus left 
me confused; this is probably less of a question and more of an appeal 
to clarification in the functioning of the tetrapolar. Apologies for my 
haziness here.

Qn 2: It seems that this exercise starts and finishes with the Spirit - 
this confuses me. I gather this again reflects my poverty in 
understanding the planar analogy. But if we start with an 'Idea', I 
don't see why and how (qn 1) this can impregnate the air which then 
moves 'up the tree' back to the Spirit again?? This seems circular.

Qn 3: On emanations from Akasha: does the Physical represent a coarser 
(and hence 'less pure') manifestation of Spirit? If so, is this due to 
a different balance of the elements - (ie. more Earth?)? Oncemore, I 
feel that I might here be misunderstanding the analogies / notion of 
elements. I read a correspondence with Rawn (Light - Fluids - Elements: 
Their descent from Mental to Astral to Physical manifestation) on the 
subject; The passage:

'in reference to the Light, the candle's flame would be a reflection of 
the astral Fire which in turn, is a reflection of the higher Light. In 
other words, the characteristics of a physical flame, through the 
process of physical materia adhering to an astral matrix, reflect the 
astral Fire Element; and the characteristics of the astral Fire 
Element, through the process of astral materia adhering to a mental 
matrix, reflect the creative Light.'

is quite illuminating (if you'll excuse the pun) - I'm still not sure 
whether I appreciate the 'why' or rather the 'how' of the emanation 
downward toward the physical.

I hope that my dilemma isn't too tedious, and that I've at least 
presented my quandary in terms that are semi-intelligible.

Many thanks for the time taken to read this,
Warm regards.

Fraternally,
Marc
