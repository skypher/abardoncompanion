<pre>Morning, all;

Thanks Rawn and P. Your comments are taken as encouragement, and a
sufficient warning.

Actually, back to the good work in the workshop, grins... Yesterday my
father in-law was discussing with me in detail the re-wiring he was
having to do in his father in laws house which is sold now and having
some last minute work done on it. In searching my four elements in
each of my three bodies while he was speaking I searched in vain. I
went to the light blue color and found myself looking only at myself,
instead of scanning for a relation to &quot;him&quot; speaking which was my
intent. I nodded to myself and cursed my working with the KTQ of the
letter A for this reason. 

I then cleansed myself and went back to my former simple method of
scanning my four elements in my three bodies (physical, astral,
mental) and located the resonating area (air, mental) of his speaking.
And that was the intent of my searching... to &quot;know&quot; within myself
where he was coming from primarily. 

So, I learned by pertinent, every day example the danger. On the
simple level that I am on, I have a lot of work letting the system be
savored by my bodies experiencing it, thereby atuning itself to these
higher natural systems. New ground. I understand, it has to be savored
in its stretching to new ground to appreciate full growth and
potential. Otherwise I will be short shifting it and not exercise it
to its potential and it will have stunted growth and not be
sufficiently developed to assit my further growth. Point well made. 

As an aside... many of us have done previous work in past years on
other methods of internal actualization. My work with the Indian
Chackras system has produced some actualization, in particular in
being able to ascertain by mind reading the intent of a person who is
directing their attention to me. What really occurs is that I have
trained (loosely trained, non structured) my inner intuition sense to
locate, feel and identify the essential &quot;feeling&quot; of the other
persons' intent about 3 seconds before they express it through words
or actions. This of course has had it's practical applications in the
office spaces that I have worked for jobs. I usually can re-direct an
angry expressive outburst in another coworker, or disperse it with
chaos or redirection on a separate matter. BUT, this intuition
untrained and sporatic initially got into my way of locating the
essence of a person's intent in speaking to me using the finly trained
skills of the Bardon IIH techniques and methods which I am now applying. 

In other words, I am having to consciously set aside my previous
released intuitions and apply consciously the more simple sets of
standards and practices which the Bardon system teaches. In doing so I
am rendering myself to be infinitely more effective and intuitive in a
knowing way, more responsible way. 

As always, I Wish you Well
Chuck
