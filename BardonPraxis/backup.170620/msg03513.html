Hi all

I forgot some general issiues/questions about introspection 
concerning search for root-cause and correlations.

Generally, as Rawn mentioned, all root cause is found within the 
mental plane. So you have to find out your *present* traits and root 
causes (guided from the inner voice of the Greater self filtered 
witin your mental) and then simoultanously transforming mental-astral-
act in step 2 ..sounds clear and quite &quot;easy&quot; as far as this 
concerns ... BUT ... *smile* ... :

1.) Bardon also mentions - in order to find all your negative traits -
to go back into your *past*. 
Does this also mean finding the root time point, when a certain 
problem or negative behaviour occured for the first time in childhood 
or within this incarnation?
William Mistele mentioned once the example, that even if someone has 
brought his character into balance to some degree at present time, 
but has not yet explored some doors closed, some past events ... he 
might loose his balance one day because it was not grounded deep 
enough or might not become fully integrated.

2.) One of my teachers described a correlation between the Astral - 
Iesod - and family/ child-parents/generation issus (like Hellinger 
stuff). The idea here is that a lot (or all) of emotional imbalances 
or negative traits come from unsolved child-parent or even - somehow 
beyond the individual itself - generation/family stuff and several 
negative individual traits would just be symptoms whereas the root 
ause would be found within a correlation between individual/family 
and therefore somehow *transcending the individual*.

Now, what is the real and deeper root cause here, familiy -
generations stuff or still mental root (together with astral-acting) 
rather to be transformed within the individual first (with automatic 
harmonising effect to family correlations/constellations as well)?

3.) Then, from chinese Medecine we do know a certain correlation 
between inner organs and emotions. For example, fear might be caused 
by the kidneys (and meridians belonging to them). So the root cause 
would rather be found and cured between a correlation context or body-
mind instead of fixing the root to a mental plane. Practically said, 
according to this model (and from my experience there is some truth 
behind) - even if you would be *temporarly* successfull in changing 
your thought-habit (fear), it would not be healed as long as the 
function of the kindney-Chi is not regulated and healed. At least and 
perhaps best way would be to bring all aspect together into balance 
mind-soul-body (+kidney Chi). So, is it right to point the root 
causes to the mental (astral-act) without involve the *correlation 
between inner organs/meridians and mental*?

4.) According to homoepathy, there is some correlation between meta-
mental root cause correlated within body *constitution*. One speaks 
of finding the remedy that is right for the individual 
constitution/physique and character. Is a constitution not much 
deeper than mental-astral patterns or just outer behaviour? And 
what's the precise correlation between mental root, character and 
constitution?


Conclusion

Such reflections *could* make the whole thing (introspection and 
character developing) much more complex or even confusing ... ;)

Is introspection and character transforming methods as Bardon it 
described enough for most students, to really integrate and transform 
all past negative incarnations traits (to reach a really well basic 
grounded Equilibrium according step 2) without use of such 
theoretical models or practical methods like Hellinger, focusing, 
transpersonal psych, general psychological knowledge etc. etc.?

Would you eventually integrate them (or some of them) while 
Introspection (as surch for root cause) or just use them afterwards 
together wits step 2 (practically) - individually - as a possible 
supplementation?

Thanks for your clarifications, ideas or suggestions
Patrik
