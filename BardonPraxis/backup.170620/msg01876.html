<pre>Dear Robert,

&gt;&gt; Could you expand on this? &lt;&lt;

The combination of mental discipline, introspection and transformation
of character are what create an astral Equilibrium of the Elements.
This means that, a) you must learn how your mind and emotions work and
become adept at consciously *using* them, b) you must transform the
negative, subconscious astral character traits that hold you back from
being your *conscious* self, and c) you must learn how to consciously
choose between the emotional responses available to you.

When you have attained these internal things, you are then in a position
to *clearly* perceive the external realm. Until that time, you forever
see *through* the filter of the subconscious mind over which you have no
conscious influence. But when you fully understand that filter and have
transformed it into a conscious tool, you can look around it, instead of
through it, and perceive the external realm as *it* is, instead of how
your psyche interprets it.

This naturally changes your relationship with, and experience of, the
external world. It no longer determines your inner state because *you*
consciously determine your own internal state. *You* are steadfast in
your own self-awareness. Prior to these attainments you were buffeted
here and there by external circumstances -- now, instead of moving you,
external circumstances move *around* you.

When you can *clearly* perceive the external world and can stand unmoved
by it, firmly rooted in your knowledge of self, you stand in a place of
great power in relation to the external world. Previously, external
circumstances held power *over* you, but now, you hold your own power
for yourself instead of giving it up to the whims of external
circumstance.

It is very much like the first mental exercise of Step One in which you
detach, passively observe and thus quiet the mind's chatter -- only then
do you have the available power to truly focus upon one thing. The work
with the astral Equilibrium is really this same process. The unexamined
and untransformed personality is the astral equivalent of the mind's
chatter. First you detach from the personality and observe it. Then
you transform it and, in essence, quiet it just like you did with the
mind chatter. Once the personality is quiet, you then have the
available power to fully focus upon the *external* world.

An important key to exercising the power to change anything is that you
perceive it clearly as *it* is. This is why the astral work begins with
introspection and the mental work begins with observation. Only through
knowing a thing first can we truly transform it. The same holds true
for transformation of the external world -- we must perceive it clearly
*first*. We must see it as *it* is, without that unconsciously imposed
filter of our own astral personality.

That is why I wrote: &quot;In order to grow in the ability to effect external
changes, the student MUST learn the ability to control their own self.
Self-control (i.e., the ability to define one's own responses to
external and internal stimuli, instead of those stimuli being the
determining factor) is an essential ingredient to attaining an Elemental
Equilibrium.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Perhaps one would see other people differently. It has been said
that where one is bound, none are free. And to realize that we are all
tared with the same brush or in the same boat, so to speak, we begin to
see why people act the way they do. I am beginning to experience a
tolerance toward other people that wasn't there before and the absence
of criticism that previously occupied by attention is no longer in
control. &lt;&lt;

That's great. :) Another aspect at play here is that when there's a
part of *you* that you want to hide away in a dark corner of your
psyche, every time you see that same part manifest externally through
another's behaviour, the perception sheds a small bit of dreaded light
upon the hidden spot within your own psyche. When that happens, the
psyche reacts with fear, anger, etc., to protect that cherished
darkness. The soul mirror work however, seeks to shed light upon every
corner of the psyche and as you progress in that work, there are fewer
and fewer dark spots that the psyche struggles blindly to protect. In
other words, as you resolve your own internal issues, the external
issues touch fewer and fewer raw nerves.

&gt;&gt; Your article on Defining Hermeticism expanded my understanding of
Hermeticism. I have not seen it explained before in such a clear and
practical way. &lt;&lt;

Cool. Glad to hear it. :)

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
