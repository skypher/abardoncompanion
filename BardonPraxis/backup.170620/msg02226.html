<pre>Dear Rawn,

Thank you for the prompt response. 

Just to fully understand the meaning of your words, I would like to 
bring an hypothetical example of some one who did a very sincere, 
thorough examination of his self. He followed his inner truth, 
listened to his inner voice. The results were quite good, and he 
came up with over 200 bad traits which he then carefully assigned to 
every element. There was only one problem, he did not fully 
appreciate the negative impact that his vengfulness had on him and 
failed to include the trait in his &quot;Black&quot; Soul Mirror. This should 
not surprise us, as he was still in the very beginning of his 
spiritual path, and his senses were sometimes deceptive. 
With years of intensive work he managed to transform his negative 
traits in the mirror into positive ones. From his point of view, he 
became a very good human being, only that he still was quite 
vengeful, and anybody around him could testify this...

Now my question is, is he a balanced human being, only because from 
his point of view he is? If all that matters is our own truth 
and &quot;Subjective vs. objective has no meaning here&quot;, this would imply 
that yes, because this is exactly what HIS Inner Voice tells him. Or 
am I wrong? 

Also, do you think that I am complicating things too much here? 

Thanks,
David

&gt; Dear David,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; BUT since I am far from perfection, since my
&gt; senses are not fully developed and since I have very little
&gt; experience in life, I consider analysing and contemplating upon the
&gt; ideas of other people - who might raise points that I have not
&gt; thought about - as an integral part of my evaluation process. The
&gt; way I see it (and please correct me if you disagree), evaluation is
&gt; when I gather all the possible and available information from all
&gt; possible sources (including mine, my parents', the milkman's and 
the
&gt; taxi drivers'), and then make MY OWN conclusion about it. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Ordinarily, that's a fine sentiment but with the Mirror work, it's
&gt; inappropriate because this is not an intellectual process. The
&gt; evaluations of the Soul Mirror are instinctual and based upon an 
inner
&gt; knowing, not upon a thinking, weighing, etc. You *know* if a 
thing is
&gt; right or wrong for you, positive or negative. The Soul Mirror 
requires
&gt; this level of introspection (*inner*-examination) instead of just 
an
&gt; intellectualization.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Since my senses are not fully developed, since my ability to 
judge
&gt; is limited, I am very likely to come to a very personal conclusion
&gt; about money, career or indeed any other topic, which from my own
&gt; perspective will be absolutely true and sincere (plus will have the
&gt; affirmation of my &quot;inner voice&quot;), but yet will be the total 
opposite
&gt; of the objective truth. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; All that matters with the Soul Mirror is *your* truth. Not what 
any one
&gt; else thinks. *Your* truth. Subjective vs. objective has no 
meaning
&gt; here.
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
