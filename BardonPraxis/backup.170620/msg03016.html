<pre>&gt;From where I sit the Step 1 work with soul mirrors is outstanding. In fact 
the whole of Step 1 is wonderful. I began by thinking I couldn't wait to 
accumulate a few elements, meet a sylph or two, and do some cool mental 
travelling 
- but this is better than any of that. It is life-changing. It is wonderful. 
As I go through it I keep thinking, I wish I could tell other people how to 
do this. I know we have to keep silent but it seems to me that the technique 
is a very valid alternative to all the me-me-meness, the endless therapy 
schools, the moral vapidity that people are subjected to. Simply exercise, have 
a 
cold shower, observe your thoughts, and write down your worst and best 
characteristics. It's... like magic! It offers perspective, I feel like I'm 
breathing for the first time in a long time to have everything just where I can 
see 
it. It's calisthenic, you do it, you put effort in and out pops reward.

One of my (Lesser) negative traits is my blabbering mouth. I want to tell 
everyone what is happening but I don't necessarily think it's such a good idea. 
All I'm saying is, I wish everyone could do this. I feel kind of separated 
from other people. Most of the people I know I would classify as 'good' people, 
which I would define as people trying to work on themselves. I think these 
techniques are like a moral boot camp, something that would clear up alot of 
issues for alot of people I know. But I also don't feel I can honestly tell 
anyone about them. I know there is a way forward that any fool can take who is 
dissatisfied with themselves, you don't need to pay fees and you will make 
progress. But I have to keep it a secret! It's hard.... that's all!

Sorry to whine, best wishes to all on the list, Jason
