&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; (My views follow, some thoughts to mull over, grist for the 
&gt; mill so they
&gt; say)
&gt; 
&gt; There is much debate over the 'value' of classic alchemical 
&gt; texts. First of all, many alchemical texts were written by 
&gt; people who already knew alchemy and (it is said) wrote more 
&gt; to show that they knew the process, and let other alchemists 
&gt; know that they knew. So, it is claimed, often they missed 
&gt; important steps in the process out, or they mixed some of the 
&gt; steps around, so those who don't know what they're doing 
&gt; cannot follow them. And of course much was written in 
&gt; allegorical language, and it can be difficult to tell which 
&gt; is being spoken plainly and straight up, and which is being 
&gt; alluded to, or described by extended metaphor (unless you 
&gt; already know the secret).
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, there is debate over who actually 'knew' the 
&gt; 'right' way, or any way at all.
&gt; 
&gt; If you read the article on the Ingaleses, entitled &quot;Did they 
&gt; confect the philosophers stone&quot;
&gt; ( <a  href="http://www.crow-caw.com/TPS%20Pages/Articles/INGALESE.TXT">http://www.crow-caw.com/TPS%20Pages/Articles/INGALESE.TXT</a>) 
&gt; Richard Ingalese is quoted as having stated that he agreed 
&gt; with the statement: &quot;Some one has said, 'You can destroy all 
&gt; other books on alchemy, for their knowledge and more is 
&gt; contained in the alchemical writings of Paracelsus.&quot; Mrs 
&gt; Ingalese told the Occult Review's Mrs McKenzie that A. E. 
&gt; Waite's edition of _The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of 
&gt; Paracelsus_ were &quot;the volumes that afforded her the most 
&gt; encouragement and help in her subsequent efforts.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; If you look at Pernety's &quot;The Great Art&quot;
&gt; ( 
&gt; <a  href="http://www.geocities.com/librorumprohibitorum/pernety-the-grea">http://www.geocities.com/librorumprohibitorum/pernety-the-grea</a>
&gt; t-art.htm)
&gt; You will find his thoughts on arriving at 'the Secret':
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Of the Means of Arriving at the Secret
&gt; 
&gt; The requirements necessary in order to arrive at this Secret, 
&gt; are: the knowledge of Nature and of one's self. One may not 
&gt; understand the first perfectly, or even the second, without 
&gt; the aid of Alchemy. The love of wisdom, the horror of crime, 
&gt; and of falsehood, the avoidance of cacochemists, the 
&gt; association of the wise, the invocation of the Holy Spirit; 
&gt; not to add secret to secret, to attach one's self only to one 
&gt; thing (because God and Nature delight in unity and 
&gt; simplicity), such are the conditions necessary for obtaining 
&gt; the divine revelation.
&gt; 
&gt; Man being the epitome of all Nature, must learn to know 
&gt; himself as the summary, the miniature of Nature. By his 
&gt; spiritual part he is allied to all immortal creatures, and by 
&gt; his material part, to all that which is transient in the Universe.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; If you do intend to work your way through the classic 
&gt; alchemical texts, then I highly recommend reading Pernety, as 
&gt; he helps describe the world of hermetic philosophy through 
&gt; which many of the classic alchemists wrote about their works.
&gt; 
&gt; Regardie's &quot;Philosophers Stone&quot; (available from 
&gt; <a  href="http://www.geocities.com/librorumprohibitorum/">http://www.geocities.com/librorumprohibitorum/</a> ) is another 
&gt; good way to get aquainted with Hermetic Philosophy as it 
&gt; relates to alchemical texts.
&gt; However it was written at a time when Regardie believed the 
&gt; texts to only relate to spiritual matters, and said 
&gt; laboratory alchemy was a load of old cobblers. (Later he 
&gt; studying alchemy from Frater Albertus).
&gt; 
&gt; Another recommended technique I've seen (which makes sense 
&gt; from a magical
&gt; perspective) is to read all you can about the life and times 
&gt; of the alchemist whose text you wish to study. Then meditate 
&gt; on the alchemist. In you inner mind assume their energy, and 
&gt; see yourself reading books on alchemy, working in the lab, 
&gt; making realisations, etc, etc... being as creative as you can 
&gt; about the whole process. From this, you can assist your 
&gt; learning about the process. If you have someone to work with 
&gt; you (who knows Hypnosis or related trance processes) perhaps 
&gt; they can guide you in this process.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, don't overlook modern books such as Herbert Stanley Redgrove's
&gt; &quot;Alchemy: Ancient and Modern ( 
&gt; <a  href="http://www.hermetics.org/ebooks.html">http://www.hermetics.org/ebooks.html</a> ) which also contains 
&gt; brief biographies of some of the classical alchemists. There 
&gt; is also plenty of thoughts (pro and contra) which can arise 
&gt; after reading modern alchemists' views on the classic texts. 
&gt; There are various groups on Yahoo dedicated to alchemy, and 
&gt; some of the practicing alchemists are willing to teach you 
&gt; what they know, but often they will require some committment 
&gt; from you in the beginning, such as obtaining labware and 
&gt; doing some of the herbal work (with little assistance) to 
&gt; &quot;prove your worth&quot;
&gt; (perhaps) ... at very least most of them seem to have a low 
&gt; tolerance to time wasters (can't blame them really).
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, I know the address of Adam McLean's site has already 
&gt; been posted but I thought it would be worthwhile mentioning 
&gt; that there is also a mirror site located at: 
&gt; <a  href="http://www.alchemywebsite.com/">http://www.alchemywebsite.com/</a> (easier to remember).
