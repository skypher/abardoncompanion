<pre>Dear Peter:

Thanks for referring to Rawn's article on Predators, Energy Vampires and Astral 
Irritations. I found that extremely enlightening and a perfect reminder because 
it has been my understanding that negative emotions such as envy for example, 
is certainly a predator and an energy vampire. All negative emotions drain one 
of vital energy.

In the bibical story of Job it was said that Job had a hedge about him. &quot;Then 
Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou 
made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on 
every side? thou has blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is 
increased in the land.&quot; Job l:9,10. 

It is my belief that magical training creates that &quot;hedge&quot; that is protective 
in nature. As the hedge is slowly constructed through one's own efforts, their 
spiritual &quot;substance&quot; is increased. This is not just referring to physical 
wealth and material objects, although in the end, Job had more than he started 
with materially. The process of transformation cleans the soul and allows that 
which is above to manifest in that below. 

Thank you, Rawn, for writing this article. It was filled with wisdom. It would 
certainly be helpful to all aspiring to be magicians.

Dear Pasha,

Welcome to Bardon Praxis.

&gt;&gt;&gt;1.Whether is in IIH ways of protection and defogging equivalent on 
efficiency to rituals: &quot;pentagram&quot;, &quot;hexagram&quot;, &quot;viewing tower &quot;...?
&lt;&lt;&lt;

Within IIH there really isn't much in the way of ritual working as 
you find within Golden Dawn, OTO and other such groups. Rather, 
Bardon presents a methodology which allows you to work with these 
energies directly, having a firm understanding of their quality and 
quantity before forming that understanding into a personalized ritual 
that is often quite a bit simpler than the rituals that you describe.

The closest thing that you'll ever find to such a working would be 
the Magic of IHVH-ADNI that is the rough equivelent of the Middle 
Pillar exercise and so much more. You can find more information about 
this at <a  href="http://www.tmo-wg.net">http://www.tmo-wg.net</a>

&gt;&gt;&gt;2.Whether has sense to practice Franz Bardon IIH to add exercises 
for development of the power centers (Chakr)??&lt;&lt;&lt;

Yes, IIH does include a methodology that helps clear out the bodies 
energetic system. One that tackles this job from the establishment of 
an elemental equilibrium within the self as well as the manipulation 
of vital energy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;3.Whether accumulation of vital force through breath by a leather
{skin} of a body can, serve as protection against a magic attack??&lt;&lt;&lt;

Yes. Though I would also suggest that you check out the following 
page as well: <a  href="../Predators.html">http://www.abardoncompanion.com/Predators.html</a>

You'll be hard pressed to find an English translation of &quot;The 
Practice of Magical Evocaton&quot; online, though there are numerous 
German editions floating around out there. You can find an online 
copy of IIH and KTQ here though: <a  href="http://bardon.freespeechsite.com/">http://bardon.freespeechsite.com/</a> 

I would caution you by restating what Bardon says within both PME and 
KTQ: these are advanced practices and should only be attempted once 
one has mastered IIH up to step 8. Though, they do give you a good 
idea as to what you should be aiming for, and the theory sections of 
both books are exceptional.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
