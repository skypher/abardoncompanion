I thank the both of you for the help and advice, and I apologize for 
the lack of alacrity in my replying - I'm currently without Internet 
access except at the university, and since I live about thirty 
minutes out it's impractical to come to town whenever I'd like to get 
on the Internet.

In any case - this has now gone from annoying to just plain 
bizarre... it seems that I've forgotten how to consciously view 
things in my mind's eye. Which is very odd - I have a very active and 
detailed fantasy life. I've analyzed this repeatedly, observing the 
way I &quot;see&quot; things when I'm fantasizing (and notably without 
flickering eyes), but whenever I try to replicate it, bam - there it 
goes. I have been able to do it on the same &quot;wavelength&quot; as the 
fantasy, so to speak, but then it's not so much that I'm visualizing 
a spoon as I'm concentrating on the concept of spoon. When I do this, 
my eyes don't flicker, but I'm not &quot;seeing&quot; the spoon in any sense of 
the word.

I know I shouldn't be, but I'm truly sorry about continuing this 
thread of discussion - I simply have no idea what to do. It pains me 
to think that my advancement is impaired by something so... niggling. 
What the heck is this?

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; This is my first message to the BardonPraxis group so let me first
&gt; say hello to everyone and what a good place this is for open and 
interesting experience
&gt; and knowledge sharing! 
&gt; 
&gt; I am on my way through step one of Bardon's IIH, and I do sometimes
&gt; like to meditate or at least relax and just let everything go and 
listen to
&gt; my body/mind flowing with energy/thoughts.
&gt; When I do this, just like you my eyelids do not close completely 
and my
&gt; right one seems to like to open when I relax my face.
&gt; I found two interesting things that may help you as well:
&gt; 
&gt; - If I am starting the relaxation, and my face is still 
wide &quot;awake&quot;, the
&gt; eyelids seem to be closed (because I am forcing them, althought not 
intentionaly)
&gt; but when I start to relax, the muscles relax and
&gt; the lids go to, what I believe, their &quot;normal&quot; position for my 
current relaxation
&gt; level (i.e. if i am still wide awake and try to relax my face, they 
will be half open but
&gt; if I am already quite relaxed, they will be almost 100% closed)
&gt; 
&gt; - Still, my right eyelid stays open just a bit most of the times 
unless I am very relaxed.
&gt; What I usually do is turn the lights off and just forget about it! 
I also started to do it
&gt; with medium lights on and &quot;train&quot; to forget about it... what 
happends is that you don't
&gt; care anymore about the light that comes through and at the same 
time because you
&gt; are relaxing, it will ultimatly close by itself! (well, actually im 
still trying to completely
&gt; forget about that light but I had some progress already... which 
means this could
&gt; actually work eheh)
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this can somehow help you!
&gt; 
&gt; All the best,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Subject: Flickering eyes
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; After achieving a certain humility and working through Step One 
&gt; &gt; (again), I've finally re-achieved Step Two, only to discover a 
rather
&gt; &gt; irritating problem of a physical nature.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Whenever I close my eyes to visualize, my eyelids start wanting 
to 
&gt; &gt; flicker open, my left one more so than the right. Of course, this 
&gt; &gt; disrupts my concentration (since I would have one eye open and 
one 
&gt; &gt; eye closed in the midst of the exercise). After a few days of 
this, 
&gt; &gt; I've experimented and found that I do the exercise better with my 
&gt; &gt; eyes open. I've also tried holding my eyes shut with a hand and 
that
&gt; &gt; enabled me to visualize as I normally would, but naturally that 
is not the
&gt; &gt; way to do it. The whole thing is rather disheartening, especially 
since I
&gt; &gt; know that either of these &quot;shortcuts&quot; would just set me further 
back than
&gt; &gt; this flaw does.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am, of course, working on my elemental balance as anyone on 
Step 
&gt; &gt; Two would, but this strikes me as being a problem of a more 
physical
&gt; &gt; nature. It only happens whenever I'm doing this particular 
exercise;
&gt; &gt; whenever I'm going to sleep and thinking my good thoughts for the 
day, it
&gt; &gt; doesn't happen. It might be psychological, but I've never had 
this problem
&gt; &gt; before.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know that it's not exactly a philosophical dilemma that 
requires 
&gt; &gt; the shifting of one's entire paradigm, but... blast, is this 
&gt; &gt; annoying! Has anyone else had this problem before?
