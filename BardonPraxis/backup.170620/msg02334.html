<tt>Between the mental exercises of step 1 and the mental exercises of step 2 
there are two major actions of the mind that need to be brought under 
control - the mind chatter and the image stream. For the exercises in step 
1, Bardon is referring to the semantic mind chatter. Basic success in step 
1 is achieved when one is able to observe the mind chatter, limit the mind 
chatter to a single semantic idea, and finally stop the chatter entirely. 
However, as one gains proficiency in stemming the mind chatter, the 
underlying, deeper, image stream becomes more and more apparent. I believe 
that Bardon left it to the individual to deduce that the same 3 part 
exercises which worked to stop the mind chatter should then be used to 
control the image stream. It is only after both of these are brought under 
control that one can expect to have success with step 2. There may also be 
a corresponding &quot;chatter&quot; for sense of smell, taste, ect., but I haven't 
come across them yet.</tt><br>

Subject: [BardonPraxis] clarity of meditation
Date: Mon, 22 Mar 2004 05:29:52 -0000</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hello, I'm new here. I've been studing Bardon's method's for about
3 monthes now but some of his comments on meditation
in &quot;Introduction to Heremetics&quot; are a little ambiguous.
First, is &quot;holding a single thought in your mind&quot; the same as
visualizing a simple object like a triangle or square? If not I am
not sure what the second part of the Magical Mental Training in part
I is asking? could it be more of an intense feeling? I know this
is a hard question to awnser, any thoughts would be useful.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Also there seems to be a gradient of clarity during my meditations
(when I am attempting part 3 of step I, the evacuation of any
thoughts from the mind) and I have been wondering exactly what level
of concentration is necessary for the completion of this step.
It seems to be that there are about 4 levels of clarity
1)an intensly outlined picture, I rarely get these anymore and only
for a second at a time.
2)a stream of thoughts with no accompaning pictures, This happens to
me now and then, maybe once per 5-10 mins of meditation, but it
happens for around 10-30 seconds at a time.
3) Pictures that are seen but are pushed out of the mind so quickly
that they are barely considered, does this count at a &quot;thought&quot;?
This happens to me fairly frequently, maybe once per 30 seconds.
4) perfect clarity, this is where you have an absolute mental
vaccum. I can usually maintain this for between 10 and 30 seconds
then I will usually have something from #3 occur then return to this
state.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">The way Bardon states it the hermeticist must maintain state #4
unbroken for 10 minutes or nearly so. This seems a bit difficult
for this stage of development doesn't it? I would expect it to take
1 or 2 years to attain that, am I doing something wrong or
interpreting him incorrectly?
Thanks alot for any comments you guys can make
-Dave</pre><br>
