&gt; Dear NB,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm obviously doing the necessary to come back to
&gt; a more balanced
&gt; behaviour (I changed the theme of autosuggestion, of
&gt; course),
&gt; particularly by inserting a notion of harmony and
&gt; balance in my
&gt; autosuggestion.
&gt; However,the fact looked interesting to me and I
&gt; wanted to know
&gt; whether others had faced the same situation. Any
&gt; idea about anything
&gt; obvious I neglected ? &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; ;-) Judging by your sense of surprise, I'd say the
&gt; only thing you've
&gt; overlooked is the fact that initiation is a
&gt; *learning* process. What
&gt; you've just described is an example of how we learn
&gt; to refine our
&gt; magical practice. We try a technique and learn from
&gt; the results we
&gt; achieve, how to better perfect our use of the
&gt; technique. Each of the
&gt; techniques you will learn from your practice of IIH
&gt; will be like this --
&gt; they evolve through continuous practice and
&gt; refinement.
&gt; 
&gt; When you *always* examine your results with a
&gt; critical and clear mind,
&gt; and *always* seek to perfect your technique through
&gt; the diligent
&gt; application of the lessons you learn through
&gt; *practical* trial-and-error
&gt; experimentation, then these simple-seeming
&gt; techniques from Steps One and
&gt; Two, will reveal themselves to be far, far more than
&gt; you had ever
&gt; imagined!
&gt; 
&gt; There's an old saying that holds great wisdom for
&gt; the magician: &quot;Be
&gt; careful what you ask for!&quot; Implied in that is care
&gt; for *how* and *why*
&gt; one asks for a certain thing. In other words,
&gt; technique and motivation
&gt; are equally important issues, both of which require
&gt; continuous
&gt; refinement.
&gt; 
&gt; In your illustration, it's obvious that you've
&gt; learned important things
&gt; about the technique, vis a vis, its powerfulness and
&gt; the finer points of
&gt; autosuggestion. And you've learned something about
&gt; motivation, vis a
&gt; vis, aiming for harmony and balance in all things. 
&gt; You've learned the
&gt; role that such factors play in your use of this
&gt; particular technique
&gt; and, undoubtedly, you've learned to be a bit more
&gt; careful about &quot;what
&gt; you ask for&quot;! ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; It's exciting when your efforts begin to bear fruit
&gt; and the techniques
&gt; show their effectiveness in no uncertain terms! :) 
&gt; It's an
&gt; invigorating time of discovery and experimentation
&gt; and endless
&gt; refinement of technique. But it's also the time
&gt; when the lessons
&gt; regarding the use of power begin to emerge. These
&gt; lessons pertain more
&gt; to the &quot;why&quot; than the &quot;how&quot; or &quot;what&quot;. Many
&gt; magicians forget the
&gt; over-riding importance of the &quot;why&quot; component and
&gt; often underestimate
&gt; its impact upon the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;what&quot;. In my
&gt; estimation, the refinement
&gt; of the &quot;why&quot; component is THE most important
&gt; potentiator of one's
&gt; magical advancement and overall evolution. The &quot;way
&gt; of the true adept&quot;
&gt; (a reference to the original German title of IIH) as
&gt; Bardon laid it out
&gt; is to refine &quot;why&quot;, &quot;how&quot; and &quot;what&quot;, simultaneously
&gt; and equally.
&gt; Hermetics is the path of balance, of an Equilibrium
&gt; between magical
&gt; technique and mystical attainment.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the lessons to be learned from experiences
&gt; such as you described
&gt; is that care must be taken when performing any
&gt; magical act. One must
&gt; learn from the consequences of one's actions and put
&gt; that learning to
&gt; good use in all of one's future actions. :)
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, Congratulations! :)
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
