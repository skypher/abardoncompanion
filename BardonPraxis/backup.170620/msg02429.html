<pre>Hi Eric,

Thanks for your comments.
I do agree with what you say.
When I write &quot;I heal&quot; I am saying that as a healer I provide the
patients body with the energy to heal itself.

I am more a person that enjoys speaking one on one. I actually dislike
writing, and am not very good at it:) My brain tends to work much faster
than
I am able to write. In the end my truth is somewhat distorted after it has
been written in a letter.

I would also like to thank all the others that have made some interesting
points.
It seems that Rawn might just need another holiday;)

When it comes to the subject of Karma there are so many what if's.
For me the most important thing is to have good intension in whatever I do,
and
to do it to the best of my ability and knowledge. Compassion for those
around us is of
utmost importance.
All that is left to do is to follow the path that Master Bardon has mapped
out for us, and
in time all the answers will come. Only then will we 'really' know the
truth.

Blessings to all of you.

Best Regards

Johan

Dear Johan,

Thanks for bringing up[ an interesting thread. I have enjoyed reading
the dialogue. I thought I would add a couple things from my own
perspective as a 'full time' 'healing practitioner'.

First of all, I don't think that healers can actually heal anyone. If
we define 'healing' according to it's root meaning 'to become more
whole', then how could we be so arrogant as to think we can make
someone else whole? People ultimately must heal themselves, and
resolving their issues and splits is between them and their Maker.
This is something each of us must do for ourselves and no healer can
do this for us, no matter how much we pay. So I don't think you can
charge money for true healing, nor can we really 'heal' a person
even if they do pay us. Holding to the misconception that we are
'healers' leads to real difficulties in the long run.

So if we are incapable of healing people, how can we charge for it?
True healing is not a product or commodity, it is not something you go
out and buy. If we hold ourselves out to the community as if we really
do heal people, I believe we are doing everyone a disservice,
especially if we charge for it. For example, your 'patients' will
become dependent on you, and often disappointed because you can't
deliver on your promise. You will get burned out eventually with this
path and with your lack of success.

So what can we do? My experience indicates that we can 'assist' people
in their own healing work, that we can shine light on the path that
they must travel in order to heal, and that we can use the healing
arts to palliate certain affections 'as a means to an end' ; but it
is an end that that they must find for themselves. By serving in this
way, we are part of their karma instead of attempting to rise above it.

&gt;From this standpoint, we can offer a service, but not a product. It
is a service that carries no guarantee or promised result. Can we
charge money for this? I think we should re- frame the question 'Do
we Need to charge for our services'? If so, then we should charge
exactly what we 'need' to charge, as long as we are truly being honest
with ourselves about what we 'need'. For example, I am someone who
felt 'called' into the healing profession at an early age. When I
examine my life, I conclude that I currently 'need' to charge
for at least some of my time and services, especially because I
need to distribute money in my role as a 'householder'. However, I
perform my services in exactly the same fashion at times when I don't
'need' to charge. I also see that, as my life goes on and I
develop, my needs change so this whole money equation may change for
the better. In the meantime, I enjoy the chances I have to serve' free
of charge'.

All the Best,

Eric





&gt; Not many people would be able to see what the patients karma is.
&gt; And not all disease is due to karma. So what right do I have to go
&gt; around starting to guess about what is caused by karma, and what not.
&gt; I take it that you meant that Pranic Healing does not conform to
&gt; Universal Legality? I do not agree. The healer cannot interfere with
&gt; the patients karma. No amount of healing I do will cure a patient if
&gt; his illness is due to his karma that has not been worked out.Worrying
&gt; about incurring karmic debt in this case would be like worrying about
&gt; incurring karmic debt every time one steps on an ant by accident:)
&gt; And as a healer one discusses these issues with a patient. I talk to
&gt; the patient and try to determine the cause of the illness. It is
&gt; discussed
&gt; that if certain changes are not made then the illness might recur. I
&gt; teach
&gt; them
&gt; about introspection and meditation etc. It is up to the patient to then
&gt; change
&gt; and learn. I must add that if I know what the problem is, and I know
&gt; that
&gt; the
&gt; patient is unwilling to learn and change, then I would consider
&gt; withholding
&gt; treatment. I have recently had a case like that with family.
&gt;
&gt; What I meant was that if someone pays me to heal them, and I take the
&gt; money,
&gt; then I have to do the healing. If they do not have the money and they
&gt; should
&gt; ask for healing, then I have the choice to heal or not. It is
&gt; important that
&gt; the patient not be burdened financially. I have no problem to heal for
&gt; free
&gt; all the time. I put the same effort in every healing session I do. My
&gt; point
&gt; is that
&gt; if I do not ask money, then the bank will repossess my car, I could
&gt; not buy
&gt; fuel to go heal,
&gt; and my son and I would die of hunger:)
&gt; I did not seek support for my view, or care if anyone wants to pass
&gt; judgment:)
&gt; I just stated a point of view:)
&gt;
&gt; I just wanted to repeat that I was in no way implying that TMO WG has
&gt; anything but the
&gt; best and most noble intensions.
&gt;
&gt; My post are not meant to criticize or insult. These are my views now.
&gt; They
&gt; may or may not change in the future:)
&gt; I do hope that those reading our posts will ponder these issues for
&gt; themselves.
&gt; Especially those in modern medicine:)
&gt;
&gt; I thank you for your kindness and great replies Rawn.
&gt; You always make me think:)
