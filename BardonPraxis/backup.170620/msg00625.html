<pre>Dear Martin,

&gt;&gt; The funniest thing happened when
I read your message. My first 'gut' instinct was to think 'well, of
course I've TRIED, that's the whole point, but it's not that easy'.
Then after a few seconds a voice in my head told me to stop being
critical; that the guy knows what he is talking about and wrote what
he wrote for a reason. Then (and this is the part I am still having
trouble believing), it was as if a switch was turned on (or off) in
my head and there and then, as I sat in front of the computer, I saw
beyond your words, the essential meaning I suppose, and I found
myself falling into a meditative state effortlessly and for 13
minutes I experienced a vacancy of mind; well actually, there were
several small stray thoughts, but it was a huge leap from my past
experiences which never lasted for more than a minute. &lt;&lt;

Excellent!!! :) :) :)

Often, success or failure with these exercises hinges entirely upon a
conceptual shift . . .

&gt;&gt; At one point I felt as if my awareness was expanding, quite
literally... that's one aspect of it that I don't think I would be able
to put into words.... &lt;&lt;

There's no need to put any more words than that to it. I know exactly
what you mean. That mental &quot;sensation&quot; of expansion is an indication of
success with the VOM. It's as if the core awareness has suddenly
relaxed and then sort of melts to &quot;fill&quot; a larger &quot;space&quot;. This points
out how thoughts/thinking confine the mind.

&gt;&gt; That was yesterday. Today I listened to your CSM recording which I
downloaded yesterday (and thank you very much for your kind offer of
sending me the CD, but my dial up connection was having a good day
yesterday and it didn't take too long to download). The meditation is
great, it really helped me to relax in a way I hadn't before with other
forms of meditation, and I believe it helped to strengthen the vacancy
of mind. I still need to work with the VOM exercise more before I would
feel happy moving on to the next step, but at least now I feel I have
something I can work towards.
I would highly recommend the Center of Stillness Meditation to
anyone working on Step One (and probably the other steps, but I have
no experience of those yet!) - it's something I intend to continue
working with as a 'lead up' to my vacancy of mind meditation. &lt;&lt;

It's very gratifying to hear that the CSM has helped you in this way.
Thank you for your kind words. :)

&gt;&gt; (I can think of one or two people who may be fuming now, &lt;&lt;

;-) Well, that's *their* problem! Besides, they haven't joined this
list.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
