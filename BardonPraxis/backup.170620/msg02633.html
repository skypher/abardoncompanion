<pre>Daniel...in respect to soul mirrors, how does a beginner deal with 
the &quot;grey areas&quot; of soul mirror work? Many flaws are obvious, but 
what about those that actually aren't flaws, but rathe misperceptions?

&gt; Dear RM and all,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Dan, you certainly have a knack for raising
&gt; &gt; interesting issues! :) 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you. One of the great joys of this Work is that,
&gt; for every issue that is resolved, another takes its
&gt; place. It certainly keeps life interesting!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Method 1 (shamanic): Become aware of where your
&gt; &gt; emotion seems to 
&gt; &gt; reside in the body. Imagine it is a kind of Astral
&gt; &gt; object that can be 
&gt; &gt; independently manipulated by your Astral self. Use
&gt; &gt; your Astral hands 
&gt; &gt; (just imagining yourself doing this is sufficient)
&gt; &gt; to reach inside of 
&gt; &gt; your body, grasp the emotion and carefully draw it
&gt; &gt; out of yourself. 
&gt; &gt; Now throw it away. When you first try this technique
&gt; &gt; you will feel a 
&gt; &gt; kind of tingling sensation in the body where you are
&gt; &gt; grappling with 
&gt; &gt; your emotion. Once you throw it away it will (at
&gt; &gt; first) generally 
&gt; &gt; come right back. As you gain experience you will be
&gt; &gt; able to throw the 
&gt; &gt; emotion away and it stays away. Back here in the
&gt; &gt; physical plane - low 
&gt; &gt; and behold, the troubling emotion is gone.
&gt; 
&gt; I like this method a lot although, as you mention, it
&gt; is probably more suited to forceful emotions. One
&gt; concern I have is that one may become reliant on the
&gt; technique. The constant use of this exercise to
&gt; eliminate negative emotions may not help the aspirant
&gt; to deal with the underlying issues causing these
&gt; emotions to arise. However, I can see a good use being
&gt; made from this if one encounters, say, a hostile
&gt; situation and uses this technique to &quot;rip&quot; out the
&gt; anger from other people. Have you tried this
&gt; particular application?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Method 2 (quasi Hermetic): English is a poor
&gt; &gt; language for describing 
&gt; &gt; inner states but I'll do my best. In this technique
&gt; &gt; you learn to 
&gt; &gt; become &quot;transparent&quot; to your emotion. You let if
&gt; &gt; flow around and 
&gt; &gt; through you while your consciousness remains very
&gt; &gt; still and does not 
&gt; &gt; interact with the emotion. You still feel the
&gt; &gt; emotion but in a more 
&gt; &gt; abstract way. I call this &quot;quasi Hermetic&quot; because
&gt; &gt; it is very similar 
&gt; &gt; to the thought observation technique described in
&gt; &gt; IIH. The emotion 
&gt; &gt; flows through you, then away and then it is gone.
&gt; 
&gt; The similarities between this technique and some of
&gt; the exercises in IIH are loud and clear!
&gt; 
&gt; After writing my last post, I meditated further on
&gt; this issue. The clear message was that we, as
&gt; students, must always bear in mind that
&gt; self-transformation is an iterative process. It is not
&gt; simply a case of creating the Soul Mirror in Step 1
&gt; and working through the major and then minor character
&gt; flaws. As Rawn notes in his commentary to Step 1 of
&gt; IIH, the Soul Mirror work should be periodically
&gt; updated. However, what one should find is that, in
&gt; creating the second Soul Mirror, the flaws that are
&gt; considered the most major (and requiring immediate
&gt; attention) are less pervasive than the most major
&gt; issues identified in the first Soul Mirror exercise.
&gt; Subsequent Soul Mirror exercises should highlight
&gt; progressively less fundamental flaws (although the
&gt; number of flaws themselves may not change, and may
&gt; indeed increase!).
&gt; 
&gt; Kindest regards
&gt; 
&gt; Dan
