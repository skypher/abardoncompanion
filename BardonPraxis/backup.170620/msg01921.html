<pre style="margin: 0em;">Allen -</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I am very glad to see this quesiton asked.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">In support..</pre><br>
<tt>I have found that the &quot;Observing thoughts&quot; step is VERY VERY helpful in 
stepping into the &quot;Focus of a thought/concept&quot; step and both advantageous to 
VOM. I find I have less mental/emotional/feeling/distraction baggage upon 
stepping into VOM when I have first stepped through the former steps.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Not only these benefits, but an increased strength of focus and intent as 
well as far less energy spent in obssessive fear based reactionary feelings 
being processes (ie - stress). I seem to need less sleep, am far more 
focused, etc.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I am sure, as I continue to practice each of these portions of the entire 
step 1 each day, I shall increasingly experience further developments as 
well as further applications of each sub-step individually as well as in the 
combined USE of each sub-step into the applicaiton of the whole. My 
expereince has been that each sub-step is designed to be utilized with the 
other sub-steps to further ones development, not to be left behind once 
10mins is reached.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>In negating such a daily practice, I expect (Rawn??) that acuity will 
fluxuate and become as it was before this thought-regime was commenced. 
Turning the strong base into a weak shell of itself and effect future 
development.</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">However...</pre><br>
<tt>I must admit, the idea of spending somewhere between 30 and 50 minutes 
(assume each step moves beyond 10mins plus mental setup/time 
checks,journaling, etc.) in the am and pm requires a disciplined approach to 
managing my procrastination.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>With this in mind, the idea of ADDING to these exercises, does seem a bit 
daunting (outside of the magic of water, 'blessing' of food, etc. which can 
be maintained during the day as opportunities arise).</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>However, I am confident that if one progresses to each new step with the 
desire/resolve to combine them as a process 2x per day (at least), one 
shall find their way to the manifestation of that desire.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I suppose it grants (forces) (allows) me some range of creative problem 
solving and the greater development of my will and purpose.</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Thank you,
:T:</pre><br>

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Dear NB,</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">&gt; I made an interesting experiment recently again. For
&gt; various
&gt; reasons, I had decided to keep practicing step 1
&gt; mental exercises
&gt; each day.
&gt;</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">What do you mean by &quot;keep practicing&quot; ? I didn't think
one was supposed to stop exercises as they moved to
the next step. I have only intensified the practice of
each exercise, even if I moved on. It would seem like
a step back if you then focused all your energy on
your new exercises and proclaimed the previous ones as
&quot;mastered&quot;, etc. Or have I understood this wrong? :-)</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">For example, I have begun step 2 exercises, but still
go through my daily rituals practicing step 1
meditations.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I still see advantages for someone say at Step 9 to
still be saying their affirmations and counting their
beads upon waking and before sleeping. Please someone
correct me if this is not so...</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Sincerely,
Allen</pre><br>
