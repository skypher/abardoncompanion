<pre>Dear Rawn,

As of late I have been looking over the work of Book 231, wondering 
if I, at this present moment, could set aside the time to go through 
this working. A question to which I have not found the answer. 
However, something else struck me about the similarity between the 
four cycles of Book 231 and the work of Franz Bardon in his three 
works.

Book 231 describes the decent from the Atziluthic state of existence 
down through Briah, Yetzirah and finially into the state of Assiah. 
Paying special attention to the realms of Briah and Yetzirah. I 
understand the reason for not including Atziluth within this work as, 
as to my knowledge, there is no representation of the Tree of Life at 
this stage of creation. Yet I do not understand why Assaiah is not 
represented within this work as represented by the conception of the 
tree of life as preented by the Ari?

Now, the work of Book 231 is split into two seperate works: that of 
creation, the decent of force into form, and that of initiation, the 
breaking of form so that it might acend into force once again. The 
work of IIH primarily seems to concern itself with the work of 
initiation and acention and integration of the paths and gates into 
the self to accuratly represent the macrocosm of the divine within 
the microcosm of the self. Which makes me wonder if performing this 
work is redundant given that one is working through the steps of IIH, 
or would it be much more of a specific integration of these concepts 
into the self.

When one looks at the works of PME and KTQ the inverse is applicable. 
One is working on the decent of form into force once more as a 
creative act of divinity. In KTQ one learns how to express each 
Letter subsequently within all four realms; akashic/atziluthic, , 
mental/briatic, astral/yetziric, and physical/assaiah. PME expresses 
both an acent and a decent; first an acent to a specific sphere and 
then the drawing it down into mental, astral and finially physical 
density. 

Bardon states within the chapter on the magical wand that the 
kabbalahistic practitioner will understand that it will typically 
take 462 individual charges for the magical wand to be effective upon 
the physical plane. In which case it was first only effective upon 
the akasha. With the first 231 accumulations the influence upon the 
mental plane increases before it starts to become effective upon the 
astral plane. With the next 231 accumulations it would seem to become 
more effective upon the astral plane before making the transfer to 
being effective upon the physical plane. While this seems all logical 
and all, I have a definet feeling that things are far from being so 
clear cut in reality as one realm bleeds over slightly into the next.

So, I guess I'm asking is, &quot;How will doing this work enrich my 
experience and abilities within Kabbalah and Evocation?&quot;

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
