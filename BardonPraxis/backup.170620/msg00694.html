<pre>To Luca Provenza, about the Anger mail.

This quote will abbreviate this mail, for those who don't have the time or 
will to read it.
Jesus Christ once said &quot;He who has not sinned, throw the first rock&quot;.

In no way, I'm an expert at expressing, either myself or any kind of messianic 
word, but I'll give you my opinion, as you requested. I sense that you are in 
need of some feeback, therefore, I will allow my senses to lead me on this 
one. ;)

Everyday, each one of us meet situations like that. And it appears to me that 
those aren't even extreme. Simply think about the hungry and/or miserable 
children all over the world, and at the fact that you have a computer, with 
an internet connection, a home, never spent a day lacking anything essencial, 
etc...

Under that perspective, I could also make a post, about how all of us live 
under some kind of luxury, and all, and we could be using the money to feed 
children, blah blah (this isn't a &quot;blah blah&quot; with disdain over the matter, 
I'm simply trying to cut this into fewer words).

You, Luca, and all of those that haven't, must acknowledge that different 
people live in different ways, and think differently. Even though Bardon 
claims that any kind of extreme behaviour isn't, most of the times, good at 
all, that doesn't make ascetism wrong. He simply states it isn't apropriate 
for eveyone. Using the Principle of Correspondence (so above as below), I 
grant that those people you meet, are simply different from you. Neither 
better or worse... perhaps that tall, chauvanist muscled man will, in a 
couple of weeks, months or years, become enlightened &quot;out of nowhere&quot;, and 
start practicing Hermetics, and even join us in this mailing list and, 
possibly, even be your Initiator, if you join some kind of Fraternity.

Do not judge them, Luca. Look inside, and know that you are also wrong in many 
ways. Do not judge the society, for you feed it, though in a different way. 
Relax, lay back, and think (meditate?) on that subject. Stop the 
concentration exercises, until you improve your innerself. 

Messianic tasks, are only for those who are ready for them. Demand more on 
yourself, than over the others. Find the truth inside of you and, if so, be 
happy for knowing that, in some way, you are better than them.

I hope some of this helps in any way. If you don't agree with everything, what 
better place could exist to debate such matters? :)

Pardon my spelling. I'm portuguese.

Yours Truly
Jo&#xE3;o Miguel Grilo Nobre Marques
