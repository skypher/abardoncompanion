<pre>Dear Joa,

&gt; But I am in TOTAL disagreement with you when you say that the best
&gt; response is &quot;to ignore the threat and not to get paranoid&quot;. Well,
&gt; I don&#xB4;t believe that a person that has been threaten of death by
&gt; a dangerous person (an assasin, for example) has &quot;paranoia&quot;. He has
&gt; REALLY a problem, and to ignore that can put in danger his own
&gt; life. If you ignore a problem when you really have a problem, then
&gt; you are doing the same thing that the ostrich: to hide your head
&gt; under the ground.

I see how I misphrased my comment, but this is not what I meant. I 
wanted to say that I believe that most &quot;psychic&quot; attacks are the 
result of paranoia or fear, and that genuine &quot;psychic&quot; attacks are 
rather rare. I never said that you should not respond to a real 
attack - on the contrary, I think you should shield yourself from it.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &quot;Instead of harming him, I think it is much
&gt;&gt; preferred to neutralize his attack&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Well, let&#xB4;s suppose that a woman is mistreated by her husband
&gt; every day, physically and psychically. She informs on the police
&gt; her case, but the police is absolutely negligent with this case
&gt; (this is something very frequent in many parts of the world,
&gt; unfortunately, and many women die).
&gt; Well, could you say me what method must employ this woman
&gt; to &quot;neutralize his attack&quot;? Sincerely, I haven&#xB4;t got very clear
&gt; how this woman could defend herself and those close to her (for
&gt; example, her children, who, in many occasions are victims of the
&gt; domestic violence too). The examples that I could put to you are
&gt; innumerable...

Every such case (and unfortunately, I am aware that there are too 
many of them) is different. In some, the woman with her children can 
escape and move to her relatives, or some other safe haven, and 
completely cut off their previous life with the abusing husband. In 
many cases there does exist such an option, but the woman does not 
realize that she is being abused or that she should protect herself 
and her children. But I digress; the woman should most definitely 
protect herself from the abuse, with the means available to her. 
But, doing so should not entail harming the abusing husband out of 
revenge.
For example, she might give him a sleeping pill, or tie him up, etc, 
and then run away. Such an action, although it did hurt him, was 
done out of necessity, and not out of revenge.
If, on the other hand, that woman would tie her husband up and then 
kill him, it would already be revenge and &quot;sense of justice&quot;, and 
not just necessity.
In short, do whatever you can to protect yourself, but make sure 
your actions indeed do come from the need for protection, and not 
from the wish of revenge.
I do not think there are as many &quot;kill or be killed&quot; situations as 
people think, and regarding those that do happen, I have no answer 
yet - I assume that for a true magician who already knows the nature 
of death and incarnation, the better action would be to let himself 
be killed in such an extreme situation, but I honestly don't know. 
Is the situation you discuss truly one where there is no other way 
to resolve it other than killing the aggressor? Is your thought 
regarding the use of black magic, aimed at protection, or at revenge?

I think that Rawn summed it up very well in his post (as he usually 
does :).

Sincerely,
Daniel Gutmanas
