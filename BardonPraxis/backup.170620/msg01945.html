<pre>Dear Jeremy, shadowdancer et al.,

I am not in a position to completely say 'yes' but I do believe there are
seriously dedicated magicians, both of white lodge and black lodge (as it has
to be, to keep all balanced).
I do agree with shadowdancers , most of the time is preferable to have a
solitary path than to mingle in the wrong groups.
But I have to say that belonging to a group doesn't have to be like
shadowdancer reported. Indeed most probably will try to 'boost' your ego by
making you feel special about belonging to the group... but again it is not
always like that.
Groups, I feel, can be a good help. In the end, I see them as a catalyser of
your own path.
They help, but the true work is done by each one of us.
As of ever meeting true Adepts, I would humbly have to say that even if I did,
I wouldn't be able to recognise one. But you do find very, I would say,
'interesting' people :)

In the end its all a matter of finding the right group for you.
And if you end up in the wrong one, its a lesson you learn :)

Just make sure you remember the basic rules, like, no money involved, no 'we
are the only ones', no 'please please join us' and you'll be fine I guess :)

All the best to you!

&gt; &gt; Dear Group,
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if there are real live practicing groups of 
&gt; magicians in the 
&gt; &gt; world? I mean seriously dedicated to the great work, exploring the 
&gt; mysteries 
&gt; &gt; magicians. People who work for the greater good and stuff like 
&gt; that. 
&gt; &gt; Especially with an emphasis on the hermetics as per mentioned by 
&gt; bardon.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I ask this because while sometimes i may not show it my family and 
&gt; friends, 
&gt; &gt; i am a social creature as are most humans and at tis point of time 
&gt; i feel 
&gt; &gt; very out of touch with the magickal community because all this 
&gt; solitary work 
&gt; &gt; is driving me nuts because i have no place to go for open trust-
&gt; worthy 
&gt; &gt; knowledgable conversation.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please do reply
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Love
&gt; &gt; Jeremy
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Jeremy, in fact there are many groups practicing whom believe that 
&gt; they are sincerely practicing the great work. I was with one group 
&gt; for about 12 years. This group really believed they were in contact 
&gt; with the great white brotherhood. You can check out the Golden Dawn, 
&gt; the Rosicrucians (in multiple flavors and amounts of 
&gt; hermeticism),Dion Fortunes Fraternity of the Inner Light, the Aurum 
&gt; Solis, the A.A. , the OTO, the Builders of the Adytum, to name a 
&gt; few. Have I ever met anyone I would consider an Adept? Nope. I find 
&gt; the groups valuable, but in the end progress comes from within. All 
&gt; groups must, by their very existance foster a feeling of separation 
&gt; from other individuals outside the order. This is, in fact, contrary 
&gt; to progress. (Keep in mind this is my opinion, and I do not consider 
&gt; myself an adept. I have had contact with members of many groups, 
&gt; though.) Keep in mind God is within you, and without you. You are 
&gt; God, and so am I. Therefore in my opinion all that leads to 
&gt; separation from others or boosting the ego in the sense that you are 
&gt; better than others is counter productive to development. And that 
&gt; seems to me to be where the group environment leads. If i had any 
&gt; right to give advice, I would say find an individual to talk to.
