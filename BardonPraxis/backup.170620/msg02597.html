<pre>Morning, Jason;

In Frabato the Magician the dark lodge goes about defeating their 
supposed enemies by causing an immediate heart attack by directing 
the death ray towards them, it works on everyone except on Frabato. 
The evil forces whom the dark lodge grand master submit to warn him 
that they may not be able to affect Frabato but the grand master goes 
ahead with the command anyway. Frabato notices he has a headache and 
balances himself and the attack averts him. Later the grand master is 
taken out of existence. 

That is the sequence I was referring to. Your responses I would agree 
with. If my statements aluded otherwise then I was in haste with 
quick answers. Our only work should be in maintaining a balance in 
ourselves and going about our duties as prescribed by divine 
providence at every moment while enjoying life, is my outlook. Divine 
Providence may do whatever He may choose, anytime, all of the time. 

I wish you well,
Chuck

&gt; G'day Chuck,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;And as you state, much as one reads in Bardon's texts. Franz 
simply 
&gt; went about balancing himself in the elements when attacked by evil. 
&gt; He did not retaliate. &lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Having only read IIH, I've little knowledge of Bardon's 
biographical 
&gt; history. In a nutshell, I'm not sure *what* he did or didn't do.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Karma, Divine Providence took care of retribution/striking back. &lt;
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to look at it that way. 
&gt; 
&gt; To me, &quot;Retribution&quot; only makes sense in the context of &quot;I must 
&gt; punish you, because you did something I don't agree with, or 
&gt; something that offends me&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; My concept of Divine Providence is of something that's infinitely 
&gt; Inclusive. Therefore, there's *nothing* in existence 
&gt; that's &quot;disagreeable&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot; to Divine Providence. 
&gt; Therefore, Divine Retribution ceases to make sense.
&gt; 
&gt; Further, my concept of Divine Providence is something that is 
&gt; Omniscient. It would, by definition, be impossible to &quot;offend&quot; 
&gt; something that sees all.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, &quot;offense&quot; only make sense in the context of Human 
&gt; morality. For example: &quot;I believe homosexuality is wrong. 
&gt; Therefore, I will be offended whenever I encounter homosexuality&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Why assume that Divine Providence applies similar moral judgements 
&gt; towards *Her own creation*? What would be the point of Infinite 
&gt; Love creating something that She was only going judge later on?
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, the phrase &quot;later on&quot; doesn't make any sense when applied 
to 
&gt; Divine Providence, if she is indeed Omniscient.
&gt; 
&gt; I can only conclude that Divine Providence does not judge, does not 
&gt; observe Morality in the way Humans do, and certainly does not dish 
&gt; out Retribution.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We get what we put out. &lt;
&gt; 
&gt; It's not clear whether you're talking about &quot;morality&quot; here, 
&gt; or &quot;actions&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you're talking your morality, well, I'd say it's entirely 
&gt; subjective. (Bardon's description of the Soul Mirror exercise 
makes 
&gt; that plain: that *YOU* judge your own morality; that there's 
&gt; no &quot;universal morality&quot; that's applicable to all.)
&gt; 
&gt; However, if you're talking actions, I'd have to agree with you. 
&gt; Because for me Karma is like this: &quot;I lay my head upon a pillow, a 
&gt; dent appears in the pillow&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; It's cause and effect.
&gt; 
&gt; See ya,
&gt; 
&gt; Jason
