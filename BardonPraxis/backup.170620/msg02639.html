<pre>Dear Dasha,

Welcome to BardonPraxis. :)

&gt;&gt; Could anybody help me to understand the connections between
the &quot;serpent power&quot; and the &quot;power of imagination&quot; and the way this
power is used in Bardon's system of initiation? &lt;&lt;

I've posted a short answer on my website at
<a  href="../Chakras.html">http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/Chakras.html</a> but for a longer answer, I
offer a message from the FranzBardonMagi which I've appended below.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark

Subject: Re: [FranzBardonMagi] Re: Kundalini.

Dear Andrew,

&gt;&gt; Does Bardon's system raise the Kundalini in the initiate and if so at
what stage. &lt;&lt;

It's not a matter of raising the Kundalini. It's a matter of the
kundalini rising *of its own accord* as a natural consequence of the
initiate's mago-mystical advancement. When initiation is *balanced*, the
chakras unfold and the knundalini rises without any ill effects. This is
because in a balanced *Hermetic* initiation, the kundalini and the
chakra system are not forced. In fact, they are not focused upon at all.

The chakras are reflective of the initiate's inner state of maturity.
They flower *of their own accord* when the initiate reaches the stage of
maturity to which they correspond. The kundalini force *of its own
accord* naturally rises to fill the flowering chakra. When this
*natural* process is left to its own wisdom, instead of being interfered
with and forced before its time, there are no ill effects. Instead, it
is empowering and immediately carries the initiate forward.

Ill effects on the other hand, are experienced *because* the individual
has not reached the stage of maturity which *naturally* unfolds the
chakras and the kundalini. In such a case, the kundalini meets
resistance in the form of &quot;impurities&quot; (i.e., a lack of maturity) and,
as is its nature when faced with this sort of resistance, the kundalini
burns away at the impurities and at the surrounding area in the
individual's emotional energy structure. From an Hermetic perspective
this is ultimately destructive because, even if the *energetic
manifestation* of those blocking impurities are effectively burned
away, the level of maturity remains relatively unchanged and those
*energetic* impurities inevitably re-manifest.

There are very complex eastern methods by which one can safely work
*with* the kundalini, but, contrary to what most westerners surmise,
they involve intensive focus upon one's level of maturity and its
growth. In other words, these methods involve a great deal more than
just trying to move the kundalini. Really, they are about using the
kundalini (very carefully and precisely) to encourage one's
maturation -- the goal being *maturation* and not the mere
movement of the kundalini.

Bardon's system sidesteps all of these issues by focusing upon
developing the initiate's mago-mystical maturity directly. In Bardon's
system, the kundalini is left in nature's hands and its rate of rising
is left to nature's wisdom based upon the initiate's own rate of
maturation.

When someone is suffering the discomforting consequences of having
forced their chakras open and their kundalini to rise unnaturally, the
remedy is to focus upon the work of character transformation. Only in
this way is the individual's level of maturity raised to par with their
unnaturally elevated or active kundalini.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
