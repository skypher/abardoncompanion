<pre>Dear Jerry,

&gt;&gt; I was concerned that many of my negative flaws actually have a
positive contribution to my personality. In other words there is
something valuable in the flaw, a hidden agenda that over the long run
is positive. Perhaps some behaviors are there to teach me to have more
fun, or quit taking things so seriously etc. However the behavior is
still a quality I do not wish to have and is a part of my shadow, so it
will be dealt with in due time. I am looking very carefully at trying to
find what the negative behaviors are trying to teach me about myself,
and perhaps adding in additional positive habits to my white
mirror....purposely developing them in myself, in order to fulfill these
needs. &lt;&lt;

A beneficial way in which to examine your negative Mirror is to consider
that at one time, each negative characteristic began as a response to a
positive need. At the time of origin, most negative characteristics
were *unconscious* and *automatic* responses to that positive need, and
it may, at the time, have been a positive reaction. However, over time
those positive responses became habitual and served your need in a less
and less positive way as you matured, resulting in a *negative* trait
now. But still at their root was an original positive need. Through
self-examination, it is possible to discover whether or not that
original positive need still exists and if it does, then it is also
possible to figure out a *conscious* and *intentional* positive way to
meet that need.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
