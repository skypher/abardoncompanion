<tt>You've pretty much hit on it. Rituals and grimoire appear to provide an 
easy answer to the work of self transformation and dealing with challenges. 
Rather than thinking of Bardon's work on a variation on the ritual based 
practices, I prefer to think of it as a western presentation of the eastern 
meditative traditions. Many of the meditative practices of buddhism such as 
mindfulness meditation and vipassana meditation can be seen in the practices 
Bardon suggests.</tt><br>

Subject: [BardonPraxis] Indroduction - Bardon's work
Date: Thu, 18 Mar 2004 17:29:14 -0000</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Greetings.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">My name is Decio, I am 28 yo from Brazil, and I just came about the
possibility of finding a discussion group of Bardon's teachings.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I've read IIH and I just thought it a great working book. Perhaps I
should better state that I've only read the thorical part of the
book, since I feel that I am still not ready to compromise myself as
much as I should to the practical exercises (I work all day and study
during night time, having only 5 hours of sleep available).</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Well my question is one based on not many sources I've found about
Bardon and his work. Everything I've seen and read that was available
to me concerning magical works, hermetics, occultists and occult
schools and the people we normally hear of associated to those topics
never mentioned anyone like Fraz Bardon, or the kind of work I've
seen in his books. Perhaps that is because I have no real contact to
the 'germanian' occultists, but no one seems to mention his work.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Also, I've participated in the O.T.O. discussion group from Brazil,
and some of the Golden Dawn ones, and not anyone I asked mentioned
Bardon's works.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">So I am curious to know why is that so. Is his kind of work, and self-
development, all that different from what those occult schools
teach? Or does it happen more because of ego (something
like 'GD', 'OTO' and all those are the elite and nothing else matters
kind of thing)?
What *are* the differences in approuch between them? Or is it
something I am supposed to discover as well by my own development?</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I think we all know that the true meaning and effects of all those
rituals, concepts and exercises from the old era are pretty much lost
today, as seems to indicate by the kind of training we found in the
original G.D. (or at least, as my minimal knowledge of it can present
me). And I am not looking for the &quot;who's the best&quot; kind of thing, but
how can Bardon's teachings work on ourselves, and what does it lacks
compared to any other kind of hermetic or occult study?</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I know this may actually be a simple question, answered quickly as I
follow my own path, but if you could show your inputs, I would very
much appreciate it.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>Light and Peace to all.
D&#xE9;cio</pre><br>
