Thanks for your reply. You understood what my problem was from how I 
described it and so your suggestion is a solution, and I'm going to 
use it and see where I can get with it.

I didn't really start working on the initiation by working on all 
three levels at the same time. I just experimented with the first 
mental excercise to see how it would be. I didn't do the excercise 
correctly and it just turned into a emptiness of mind excercise 
where I was cancelling out all the thoughts that came into my head. 
It had a very relaxing result but that was the only positive of the 
excercise, I had it wrong. Thanks again for your help.

&gt; &gt;how we can be detached from a train of thought 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If you are able to know that you are detached from a train of 
&gt; thought, then you are at a certain stage of development... but no 
&gt; matter where one is one must attack personally the exercise of 
Step 
&gt; 1. So, from where you are, emptiness of mine, with 'no' thought 
&gt; occuring at all... ask yourself this... (when you're there, not 
here 
&gt; and now in logicizing it all in typing)..
&gt; 
&gt; Just say;
&gt; There is no thought, without my thinking of a thought.
&gt; 
&gt; relax and immediately listen in the silence.
&gt; Do it a couple of times, there 'should' be a voice repeating what 
you 
&gt; just said. Now... 'there' is a place to go to. Go to that place 
where 
&gt; the thought was repeated. Listen to it, again and again, just let 
it 
&gt; repeat it and anything else that it is saying. You should be able 
&gt; tolocate some place in yourself that is making these statements.
&gt; 
&gt; If not, then it is entirely possible that you are not doing these 
&gt; exercises but just thinking about doing them soon in the near 
future 
&gt; and this is your preparation work, and you are intellicizing it. 
If 
&gt; that is the case then that is where we are not addressing what you 
&gt; are asking. Because we are giving you instructions in experiencing 
&gt; it, as we are experiencing it. If you are not into experiencing it 
&gt; but just in logicizing it then that is another matter.
&gt; 
&gt; Logicizing. There is a still, quiet voice within each of us. There 
is 
&gt; a voice of our merged mind, thought, feeling, experiential 
humanity 
&gt; past, and fantasy future. All of these are different aspects of 
&gt; thought that are possible and we use these merged functions to 
speak 
&gt; and think and communicate to ourselves as well as others. The 
Bardon 
&gt; methodology is concerned with doing inside mental work in locating 
&gt; the occuring place of each of these (and other) functions. Once 
&gt; located they can be controlled once one has learned to apply 
oneself 
&gt; to the basic tenents of nature. This, as well as having access to 
a 
&gt; higher sense of virtues is all that the methodology is all about. 
&gt; 
&gt; So, the first Step is closing ones eyes and facing the fact that 
one 
&gt; thinks. How does one think? Where does one think from? Follow one 
&gt; thought and find out for yourself. For it is only in finding for 
&gt; yourself that you know. And the prize is knowing. 
&gt; 
&gt; Be well,
&gt; Chuck
