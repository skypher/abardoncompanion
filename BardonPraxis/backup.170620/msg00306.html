<pre>Dear Jason,

Actually I had the same thing happen to me for the first time, just a few 
days ago. I just got my negative soul mirror together, almost, anyway, and 
was thinking about the depth of negativity I have unearthed. I forced myself 
to write down things I never even had admitted to myself. I knew I wanted to 
work right away on the positivisation.

We had a meeting at my house, one was a person I'm not really sure I fully 
understand how I feel about her. 
Instead explaining all the boring details of this meeting, I'll cut right to 
the quick. When we started talking, I kept laughing at her, cynically, 
showing her clearly what I thought of her. I felt bad while I did it, 
thinking, why do you do that? You are a spiritual warrior, a student of 
Hermetics.... why on earth do you act like that? It's despicable! She 
isn't trying to be hurtful (even so she has been, very badly so), she simply 
doesn't know better. Treat her with kindness, stay in your heart....
I couldn't do it and was ashamed of myself. But the way I acted out was a 
combination of several of my negative traits I wrote down, and they hit me so 
hard, I was powerless to stop it.

So, is this to be expected? I don't know, It surely hit me like a ton of 
bricks!

&lt;&lt; Howdy folks,

Was just wondering if any others experience the following, while 
working on the positivisation of a negative quality......

I've repeatedly found that the quality presently being worked on 
tends to *magnify* itself in my life - almost as an explosive parting 
gesture! ;-)

For example, working on the removal of &quot;Impatience&quot; may result in an 
abnormally high number of opportunities to *experience* impatience. 
Almost as though the Universe is saying &quot;You want to be rid of this 
quality? Well, let's see how serious you are!!&quot; ;-)

Has anybody else experienced this, and can it be considered 
an &quot;expected&quot; part of the process?

Thank you all!

Jason
