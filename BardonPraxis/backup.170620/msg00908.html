Hey Kurt,

I have told a few of my friends about Bardon/Hermetics, but mostly the
like-minded ones. They have their own path's but we often get into very
interesting discussions. One friend borrowed my copy of Kybalion and
loved it and ended up passing it around to some others.

For those that I am not as close to I usually tell them that I'm busy
(which is true) or that I need time out to relax, but ask them what
they're doing on the weekend/etc and actively organise another time to
meet up and hang out so they don't feel like i'm snubbing them.

Paul

&gt; Hi Guys and Girls.
&gt;
&gt; I have a question regarding the Seal of Silence.
&gt;
&gt; I have been practising IIH for the past year and a bit. Obviously to
&gt; take it seriously, I've had to introduce some major (but positive)
&gt; aspects of my life.
&gt;
&gt; Now, when my friends used to say &quot;Come out and do xyz with us&quot;, I
&gt; could get out of it by saying I had 'meditation' to do, or I could
&gt; plan my exercises around my friends engagements.
&gt;
&gt; But now I'm busier, so I have less time to go to all my friend's
&gt; get-togethers. This means I can't usually move my exercises around
&gt; because I have work, or want to see my partner etc. So all I can say
&gt; is &quot;I have meditation to do&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; The thing is, I feel kind of guilty about this, because they assume I
&gt; 'meditate' maybe an hour or possibly two at the most, each day. In
&gt; reality, it is more than this, so it comes out looking like I am
&gt; using
&gt; meditation as an excuse not to see them.
&gt;
&gt; What I really want to say is;
&gt; I'm pursuing a path of enlightenment
&gt; I'm still friends, but sometimes enlightenment will take precedence.
&gt;
&gt; Is this revealing too much? I wouldn't ever tell them about Bardon,
&gt; Magic, or any techniques/experiences. And if they asked I would tell
&gt; them it's personal and I don't wish to talk about it specifically.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone else gone through this, and what did they do?
&gt; All suggestions are welcome. Please don't hold back, as I am in need
&gt; of some inspiration.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, and take care
&gt;
&gt; Kurt
&gt;
