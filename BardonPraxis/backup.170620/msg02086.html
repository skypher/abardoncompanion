<pre>Dear louis ~

The debate of drug use is so filtered through political agendas and 
propaganda that you will be hard-pressed to find a rational answer on 
this matter. Whatever you are likely to hear will always be angled 
from the personal opinion of the person you ask, which in the case of 
drugs usually is very hot indeed!

The fact of the matter is that psychedelic drugs have been used as 
sacramental medicines (ie entheogens) as far back as the history-
books go. Like any tool, they can be used or abused; that is, they 
can be used with merit or they can lead to harm.

Bardon never revealed his position on the matter, at least to my 
knowledge. One might assume that his position is the same as with the 
other substances which he actually mentioned in IIH.

You might find answers to what you are looking for by checking out 
www.erowid.org, and the material by Hoffman and Leary.

In either case, the dispute as to whether spiritual experiences 
triggered by the use of entheogens are valid or not is up to 
individual experience. The fact the wise Initiate will understand is 
the same as that of any tool: not to allow it to become a crutch. By 
practicing IIH, for instance, the Initiate will eventually be able to 
produce any state of mind, far surpassing that of any drug, Hirself. 
Furthermore, it will then be under the utter control of the balanced 
Initiate, rather than the entheogenic experience of being thrown in 
the deep of a turbulent ocean not even knowing if one can swim.

Are psychedelic drugs dangerous? First of all, I find it amusing that 
anyone professing to become One with God would even grasp at 
comfortable safety. That said, I guess you could say that any given 
drug is as dangerous as the individual taking it. It is the greeting 
and embrace of a foreign chemical-structure into one's own, after 
all. Are the two synergistic or incompatible. No two people react the 
same to a psychedelic. No two meetings with a psychedelic is ever the 
same for the same person, even.

I'm closing my rambling with this: Do what you Will. Be responsible 
and set serious goals, and you'll likely be alright. Recreational use 
of entheogens is a despicable abuse... Ooops! There's that 
politically correct propaganda again... Sorry! ;-)

Well met
Vovin
