<pre>Basim,

Do you think that stress in your life is adversely affecting your 
magical ability? Perhaps if you just let your eyes flicker and not 
care about it, the problem will resolve itself.

Hope this helps,
Dan

&gt; I thank the both of you for the help and advice, and I apologize 
for 
&gt; the lack of alacrity in my replying - I'm currently without 
Internet 
&gt; access except at the university, and since I live about thirty 
&gt; minutes out it's impractical to come to town whenever I'd like to 
get 
&gt; on the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; In any case - this has now gone from annoying to just plain 
&gt; bizarre... it seems that I've forgotten how to consciously view 
&gt; things in my mind's eye. Which is very odd - I have a very active 
and 
&gt; detailed fantasy life. I've analyzed this repeatedly, observing the 
&gt; way I &quot;see&quot; things when I'm fantasizing (and notably without 
&gt; flickering eyes), but whenever I try to replicate it, bam - there 
it 
&gt; goes. I have been able to do it on the same &quot;wavelength&quot; as the 
&gt; fantasy, so to speak, but then it's not so much that I'm 
visualizing 
&gt; a spoon as I'm concentrating on the concept of spoon. When I do 
this, 
&gt; my eyes don't flicker, but I'm not &quot;seeing&quot; the spoon in any sense 
of 
&gt; the word.
&gt; 
&gt; I know I shouldn't be, but I'm truly sorry about continuing this 
&gt; thread of discussion - I simply have no idea what to do. It pains 
me 
&gt; to think that my advancement is impaired by something so... 
niggling. 
&gt; What the heck is this?

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is my first message to the BardonPraxis group so let me first
&gt; &gt; say hello to everyone and what a good place this is for open and 
&gt; interesting experience
&gt; &gt; and knowledge sharing! 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am on my way through step one of Bardon's IIH, and I do 
sometimes
&gt; &gt; like to meditate or at least relax and just let everything go and 
&gt; listen to
&gt; &gt; my body/mind flowing with energy/thoughts.
&gt; &gt; When I do this, just like you my eyelids do not close completely 
&gt; and my
&gt; &gt; right one seems to like to open when I relax my face.
&gt; &gt; I found two interesting things that may help you as well:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - If I am starting the relaxation, and my face is still 
&gt; wide &quot;awake&quot;, the
&gt; &gt; eyelids seem to be closed (because I am forcing them, althought 
not 
&gt; intentionaly)
&gt; &gt; but when I start to relax, the muscles relax and
&gt; &gt; the lids go to, what I believe, their &quot;normal&quot; position for my 
&gt; current relaxation
&gt; &gt; level (i.e. if i am still wide awake and try to relax my face, 
they 
&gt; will be half open but
&gt; &gt; if I am already quite relaxed, they will be almost 100% closed)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Still, my right eyelid stays open just a bit most of the times 
&gt; unless I am very relaxed.
&gt; &gt; What I usually do is turn the lights off and just forget about 
it! 
&gt; I also started to do it
&gt; &gt; with medium lights on and &quot;train&quot; to forget about it... what 
&gt; happends is that you don't
&gt; &gt; care anymore about the light that comes through and at the same 
&gt; time because you
&gt; &gt; are relaxing, it will ultimatly close by itself! (well, actually 
im 
&gt; still trying to completely
&gt; &gt; forget about that light but I had some progress already... which 
&gt; means this could
&gt; &gt; actually work eheh)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope this can somehow help you!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; All the best,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;basim326&quot; &lt;basim326@y...&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Flickering eyes
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; After achieving a certain humility and working through Step One 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (again), I've finally re-achieved Step Two, only to discover a 
&gt; rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; irritating problem of a physical nature.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Whenever I close my eyes to visualize, my eyelids start wanting 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; flicker open, my left one more so than the right. Of course, 
this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; disrupts my concentration (since I would have one eye open and 
&gt; one 
&gt; &gt; &gt; eye closed in the midst of the exercise). After a few days of 
&gt; this, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've experimented and found that I do the exercise better with 
my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; eyes open. I've also tried holding my eyes shut with a hand and 
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; enabled me to visualize as I normally would, but naturally that 
&gt; is not the
&gt; &gt; &gt; way to do it. The whole thing is rather disheartening, 
especially 
&gt; since I
&gt; &gt; &gt; know that either of these &quot;shortcuts&quot; would just set me further 
&gt; back than
&gt; &gt; &gt; this flaw does.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am, of course, working on my elemental balance as anyone on 
&gt; Step 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Two would, but this strikes me as being a problem of a more 
&gt; physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; nature. It only happens whenever I'm doing this particular 
&gt; exercise;
&gt; &gt; &gt; whenever I'm going to sleep and thinking my good thoughts for 
the 
&gt; day, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't happen. It might be psychological, but I've never had 
&gt; this problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; before.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know that it's not exactly a philosophical dilemma that 
&gt; requires 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the shifting of one's entire paradigm, but... blast, is this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; annoying! Has anyone else had this problem before?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
