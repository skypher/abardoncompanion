Thanks, Jason;

I used Rawn's CSM and TMO quite a lot at the beginning of my 
studies. At one point I found out that I was stretching way too thin 
with 8 Temples, Rawn's web site, the Archaeous... and it all was 
pulling 'me' 'myself' (not that it would also do it for anybody else 
as it did to me, just my personal call on my own growth) way too far 
off track from the first three Steps of IIH. 

So, I backed off from 'other' possible helpful studies and I focused 
only on Bardon techniques in the steps themselves.

So... there is far too much on Rawn's site for me to remember or 
recall what specifically you are referring to. :)

Do you mean the picture of a circle divided into quadrants, red-
fire, green-water, blue-air, and yellow-earth? Where it signifies 
hot, dry, wet, moist, etc? I know that one if you mean that. I 
printed that one out a year and 1/2 ago and have it around. 

About all I got from your own personal experience in that 
description was that through meditation you actually ascertain 
the 'movement' 'motion' of the four elements. Please don't take this 
as getting down on you Jason. It's just that &quot;I&quot; love personal 
descriptions from others' experiences. And 'this' has helped me out 
the most in deciding whether to go this or that way in my 
studies, 'then' I apply myself and come to my own decisions. But it 
is 'always' helpful to me to get others' descriptions of their 
experiences :)

Please take that as encouraging and not putting down in any way. 
It's just that there's so much more you could be saying that I want 
to touch and be touched with inside of your experiences :)

I wish you well
Chuck

&gt; Hey Chuck,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;but what exactly do 'you' mean when you 
&gt; use the tetragrammaton in the meditation please?&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry if I wasn't clear, but I thought I was. Did you never see 
that diagram 
&gt; of the tetragrammaton though? I was operating on the assumption 
that you've 
&gt; read Rawn's stuff, but maybe you haven't. In IIH there isn't an 
actual 
&gt; *picture* of the tetragrammaton, a *diagram* I mean to say, but 
you can find how to 
&gt; draw a simple one in Rawn's theory notes on his site.
&gt; 
&gt; Once you have that you'll see what I mean... which is, the 
tetragrammaton 
&gt; just means the four elements, the tetrapolar magnet, considered 
as a single 
&gt; interacting unit that springs from the 5th element. By meditating 
*on* it, you 
&gt; see not only the characteristics of each element individually but 
also why 
&gt; they *must* have those characteristics, given how they interact. 
How anything 
&gt; can be considered as composed of them only. Why whatever is not 
one must be 
&gt; another. Etc etc. The tetragrammaton is not really a static 
symbol, it implies 
&gt; kinds of motion.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope that clears that up? But am not sure! best Jason
