<pre>Dear Alan,

Thank you for this reply. It was very beautiful. I
don't find it harsh at all and I agree absolutely.

My friend recommended that I might volunteer to help
less fortunate people - he believe it really helps one
to connect more to people and develop a deeper love
for mankind.

During my meditations last night, I was reminded there
are people like Victor Frankl, who did not judge his
captors and managed to create peace from within. Quite
a mighty feat considering his circumstances.

Sincerely,
Allen

&gt; Dear Allen,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Yet, on the other side of the coin, I notice that
&gt; I am beginning to
&gt; deal with people more as an observer. I listen to
&gt; what they are
&gt; saying, talk less, smile, and rarely become
&gt; interactive anymore in a
&gt; conversation, especially if I sense anything
&gt; negative or not
&gt; spiritually beneficial. To be honest, the daily
&gt; concerns of most
&gt; people is beginning to feel like a chore to listen
&gt; to. I am sure
&gt; people are noticing this new behaviour. I even
&gt; notice people getting
&gt; mad because I do not choose anymore to &quot;participate&quot;
&gt; in their emotions
&gt; as I may have before. I also choose to keep my
&gt; spiritual life very
&gt; private and never talk about it, but there are
&gt; always clever people
&gt; who notice things... &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; To add to what Rawn said, your new behavior is
&gt; becoming more and more
&gt; anti-social. I should know, as I am :) But it's
&gt; something that I'm
&gt; working on to overcome.
&gt; 
&gt; To see why this behavior isn't the greatest in the
&gt; world, simply look
&gt; to Bardon. He was doctor, helped the sick, cared
&gt; for people, and did
&gt; a great many services to humanity. Yet he had a
&gt; family: a wife and
&gt; children. I'm sure he was delighted when his son
&gt; brought a paper with
&gt; nothing but mere smears of color and said &quot;Look
&gt; Daddy I drew you!&quot; 
&gt; I'm sure he was concerned when his children started
&gt; school and felt
&gt; all of the normal emotions that all parents do. But
&gt; I'm sure he
&gt; handled them differently. On the surface he was
&gt; &quot;Franz Bardon -
&gt; Parent&quot;, but underneath he was &quot;Franz Bardon - Magus
&gt; Parent&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; So distancing yourself from people is not a good
&gt; thing in general,
&gt; especially people that you care about. I'm not
&gt; saying that you should
&gt; simply do what you have always done either. But
&gt; should simply be what
&gt; you were before, but in addition be the new you. 
&gt; It's not a cutting
&gt; off of the old self, its a transmuting of the old
&gt; self into the new. 
&gt; The old must be incorporated in the new self but in
&gt; a new light. To
&gt; make it better, not worse. If something that you
&gt; are doing is causing
&gt; problems, chances are that it is not a positive
&gt; behavior, but rather a
&gt; negative one. Of course, no one can really judge
&gt; this but you. But
&gt; for myself, I don't see how I can be a humble
&gt; servant to mankind if I
&gt; don't care anything for them. And that is why I am
&gt; transmuting the
&gt; &quot;anti-social/detachment towards people&quot; into the &quot;I
&gt; care about
&gt; people&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure some of this will apply to you and other
&gt; part not so. I can
&gt; only base what I say upon myself. So take no
&gt; offense if something
&gt; seems harsh, as it was, at one time, directed
&gt; towards myself ;)
&gt; 
&gt; All Will Go Well,
&gt; --Alan
