<pre>Dear Daniel,

&gt;&gt; I understand, but what if the person developing that mathematical
model is not interested in initiation, nor is he able to know/act as
Unity; if bright enough, would such a physicist be able to make such a
limited model of, for instance, just the astral? &lt;&lt;

I don't know enough about mathematics to be able to say decisively one
way or another, but in any event if it does prove possible, it would
ultimately be a self-destructive model since it would contain no true
experiential understanding of how the astral relates to the mental or
Akashic realms. No realm exists *by itself* and without an
understanding of how the *whole* inter-relates, then the model would not
be able to fully harmonize with that *whole*. This is why I say it
would be self-destructive. For example, look where acting upon the
scientific model of the physical universe has brought us. I was
commenting to a friend just yesterday that, based upon that model, we
have replaced streets filled with horse manure, with air filled with
carcinogens.

&gt;&gt; The reason I'm asking is not because it is a path of work I'm
personally interested in, I'm more than content with Initiation :),
but the issue worries me - if the answer is positive, it would mean
that there is a way to circumvent the natural prerequisites for
utilizing above-physical forces, even if only in a limited and not-
really-understanding way. The process of initiation should instill
in a person responsibility and understanding, while a scientist does
not have these qualities. &lt;&lt;

Well, *every* one of our actions utilizes &quot;above-physical forces&quot;.
There's no separating &quot;physical forces&quot; from &quot;above-physical forces&quot;.
The question then is one of *intentional* or *conscious* use and the
degree of understanding one possesses in regard to those forces. We
don't especially notice the &quot;above-physical forces&quot; at play in each of
our actions because we aren't making conscious or intentional use of
them -- for most folks, there isn't an inkling of understanding of those
forces or awareness that they even exist. In some cases, there is some,
incomplete understanding of the *effects* of those &quot;above-physical
forces&quot; and conscious intentional use is made of that &quot;knowledge of
effect&quot;. A good example would be modern advertising -- through color,
sound, image and idea, advertisers manipulate the astral matter of their
target audience and convince them to patronize whatever is being
advertised. Do they understand the astral realm? No, but still they
know *through observation of effects* how to in-directly manipulate it.

On the other hand, the magician manipulates the astral matter
*directly*, consciously and intentionally, and based upon her or his
experiential understanding. To gain that experiential understanding and
the ability to *directly* manipulate the astral or the mental materia,
implies a process of *self* transformation. Without undergoing that
process (i.e., initiation), the *direct* manipulation is impossible.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
