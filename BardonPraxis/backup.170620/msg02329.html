<pre>Hi All,

&gt;&gt; I prefer to think of it as a western presentation of the eastern  
meditative traditions

I thought the above post potentially misses the point of everything 
that is. Western or Eastern practices are no refelction on each 
others, both being similiarly valid, they are only separate methods 
which reflect elements of each other via both of their truths - which 
both individually reflect the needs of the individual demographics, 
but both are fully part of the truth and the ALL.

East or west is irrelevant, they are both simply methods of becoming 
part of truth of what *IS*.

I have seen from many groups in the near past that a degree of 
*clique* mentality seems prevalent not from the underlying 
recognition of truth but elements of individuals personality and 
experience which is not being quantified in terms of pure 
objectivity; a point potentially worthy of meditation.

&gt; &gt;Subject: [BardonPraxis] Indroduction - Bardon's work
&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 18 Mar 2004 17:29:14 -0000
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Greetings.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My name is Decio, I am 28 yo from Brazil, and I just came about the
&gt; &gt;possibility of finding a discussion group of Bardon's teachings.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've read IIH and I just thought it a great working book. Perhaps I
&gt; &gt;should better state that I've only read the thorical part of the
&gt; &gt;book, since I feel that I am still not ready to compromise myself 
as
&gt; &gt;much as I should to the practical exercises (I work all day and 
study
&gt; &gt;during night time, having only 5 hours of sleep available).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well my question is one based on not many sources I've found about
&gt; &gt;Bardon and his work. Everything I've seen and read that was 
available
&gt; &gt;to me concerning magical works, hermetics, occultists and occult
&gt; &gt;schools and the people we normally hear of associated to those 
topics
&gt; &gt;never mentioned anyone like Fraz Bardon, or the kind of work I've
&gt; &gt;seen in his books. Perhaps that is because I have no real contact 
to
&gt; &gt;the 'germanian' occultists, but no one seems to mention his work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Also, I've participated in the O.T.O. discussion group from Brazil,
&gt; &gt;and some of the Golden Dawn ones, and not anyone I asked mentioned
&gt; &gt;Bardon's works.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So I am curious to know why is that so. Is his kind of work, and 
self-
&gt; &gt;development, all that different from what those occult schools
&gt; &gt;teach? Or does it happen more because of ego (something
&gt; &gt;like 'GD', 'OTO' and all those are the elite and nothing else 
matters
&gt; &gt;kind of thing)?
&gt; &gt;What *are* the differences in approuch between them? Or is it
&gt; &gt;something I am supposed to discover as well by my own development?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think we all know that the true meaning and effects of all those
&gt; &gt;rituals, concepts and exercises from the old era are pretty much 
lost
&gt; &gt;today, as seems to indicate by the kind of training we found in the
&gt; &gt;original G.D. (or at least, as my minimal knowledge of it can 
present
&gt; &gt;me). And I am not looking for the &quot;who's the best&quot; kind of thing, 
but
&gt; &gt;how can Bardon's teachings work on ourselves, and what does it 
lacks
&gt; &gt;compared to any other kind of hermetic or occult study?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I know this may actually be a simple question, answered quickly as 
I
&gt; &gt;follow my own path, but if you could show your inputs, I would very
&gt; &gt;much appreciate it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Light and Peace to all.
&gt; &gt;D&#xE9;cio
