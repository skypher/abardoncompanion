Grins, Jason;

I'm not at step 1, 2 and 3 of IIH, I am at Step 5, 6, 7, 8 (grins).

One can only be at one place at one time, one step at one 
time, 'unless' one uses magic and for instance has their mental body 
at Step 10, their astral body at Step 9 and their physical body at 
Step 8. Laughs! slapping my knee laughing. 

Jason, I am 'not' trying to gain anything from you of what I should 
rather be experiencing myself. I am not trying to short shift myself 
and get you to do the work for me. I am not saying what step I am on 
for the same reason that it is simply nobody's business and would do 
noone any good anyway to know. That having been said I guess what you 
are reading or picking up on is my energy, enthusiasm... and you 
evidently are not understanding what I am getting at. 

&quot;What picture of the Tetragrammaton&quot; are you referring to. And yes, I 
asked if you could explain for others' sake 'what' the experiences 
you are referring to from the tetragrammaton are like for you 'for 
instance' (just an example or two) so that others could 'relate' to 
what you are saying, because, there, ... see? they have a concrete 
example by your example of the idea that you are setting forth. 

(And you did give a few examples of anger/fire/love/Shakespear)

Then I can nod and say along with you, yes, that is one of the great 
things about the tetragrammaton and the illustration Rawn gave. 
Instead I am not sure what exactly you are referring to. 

Ever try to read the design on a spinning top while it is spinning? I 
don't, I just wait until it stops and read it then. So, Jason I am 
not going to try again to understand what you are saying while you 
are spinning. Laughs! 

By the way. I think that others experiences, clearly and simply 
explained are of great worth to beginners and others is why I take 
the time to explain at all. 

By the way;
------------
I look, for instance, inwardly and see a dark expanse of emptiness. 
Suddenly a series of rings appears on a flat surface which has just 
revealed itself having been there all along. A thought picture 
occuring in me spontaneously from somewhere sparked off the rings 
like a pebble plunking into a shallow small lake top. The rings go on 
and on, slowing as they reach farther and farther from the 
originating spot where they pierced the layer of air separating the 
water. The rings are farther spaced apart from each other the farther 
they reach from their beginning in the continuing journey.

I sense the ring or ripple in this case, slowing to an almost 
imperceptible motion as a backlash from the bank counteracts its' 
motion with a counter motion absorbing it suddenly into motionless 
silence. 

I recall then the moment of the air, the last moment of being and 
motion before slapping headlong into the hard cold surface of the 
stagnent water. Last moments of freedom. I make my impression as I 
disrupt the calm and serene invisible surface of the lake and cascade 
into a limitless array of ripples. I am lost and changed. I awaken as 
a steady moving tide of water, a part of the ripple, one ring on the 
continuous flowing cool surface of shrunken possibilities. The ripple 
that I am now is possibly best described as a fire element reaction, 
motion, direction, volition impressed and carried on the form of 
water. The space between ripples perhaps are the allowed and possible 
undulations of the life within my sine wave of expression. 
Encountering the earth lake bank I retreat as my only possible 
reaction to this solid and formidible giant of stance. Solid forming, 
I retreat back to the warmth of the cool emotions of the lake. 
Suddenly I am met by an oncoming previous expression of my feeling 
and ride, and I ... am .. no ... more. Once again the silence of the 
nothingness returns, perhaps to be interrupted again by a thought, or 
a feeling. Ummmm... sigh. I just want to rest and be no thing.
-------------
That is what I do sometimes while meditating on the tetragrammaton. 
But it's just an example and only one form of expression the elements 
impress on me while in differing meditating states. 

I wish you well,
Chuck
