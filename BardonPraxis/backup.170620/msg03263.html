<pre>I want to ask what may be a stupid question connected with this: is it 
absolutely unheard of for someone to find the Step 1 Mental exercises to sort 
of 
be in reverse order of difficulty? That is, to find VoM relatively easy but 
the witnessing of a normal flow of thought rather hard? I ask because I think I 
have experienced a version of what Martin is talking about here all my life, 
and can sort of turn it on and off at will. That whole thing of being blank 
and everything around me being conscious is very familiar to me.

Maybe I'm missing something, and certainly I've never tried consciously to 
make that state last any particular length of time, but I wonder if it's 
possible to find this 3rd exercise easier than the other two? Does that make 
any 
sense to anybody?

If I were to describe the way the blank state I'm thinking of feels to me, 
it would be - a long _pause_, with no thought, I can feel my body and 
everything around me but I don't pay it any attention or identify with anything 
in 
particular. And the thing of everything being conscious is like - you see 
something and it kind of becomes you, or is like you, or feels as if it could 
talk or has a soul or personality and is filled with what one might call 
itselfness?

I've never experienced that big surge of energy though or anything like it, 
and I've never even thought there was anything special about that state! 
Although I did connect it with being an aware person and also generally a 
weirdo....

If this is or has anything to do with 'VoM' I've been doing it since I was 
very young, but have often had more difficulty identifying with my *own* 
thoughts and feelings! Again, I know Bardon says that &quot;everyone's development 
is 
very individual&quot;, but it seems to me this is almost ludicrously so, getting the 
3rd exercise right away but having trouble with the 1st forsooth! I might be 
missing something or not have got the real deal here, so if anyone could 
tell me.... thanks, Jason
