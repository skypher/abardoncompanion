<pre style="margin: 0em;">Dear Darryl,</pre><br>
</blockquote><tt>- how can they tell someone that his spirit is inferior
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">just because he is a member of a certain race, and has a certain
skin color?
</pre></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>Darryl,</pre><br>
<tt>Respecfully, please let me suibmit that it may be an error to suggest (even 
accidently) that the source of racism is from a belief that a particuler 
persons 'spirit' or 'person' or any portion of that whole is &quot;inferior&quot; b/c 
that person is a member of a certain race/creed/etc. It may be characterized 
as a *belief*. However, most beliefs are habitualised accidently over time 
and often based in fear and self-protection and all sorts of things.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>THeir is an idea out there that each race brings with it its own gifts to 
the world of races. Everyone wants something that is particularly theirs and 
makes them feel special that they are responsible with the husbanding of. 
This often turns to Vanity of race thought when &quot;seekers&quot; &lt;gag&gt; come upon 
this idea (1880's ..?). It makes sense to them b/c they sense generalised 
egregores associated with belief systems surrounding races. They see the 
reflection of it in themselves. &quot;Where did my pregudices originate from?&quot;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>On a more personality , average cultural racism level..<br>
In my estimation, it may mainly (added to by ones own life experiences and 
reactions) be b/c of cultural parent to child assistence in being suspicious 
and perhaps even fearful of the particuler race's pregudices against others 
(blaming them for their own woes, fearful of the ignorance and aggression of 
others experienced in the past, generally EXPECTATIONS of the race behavior 
from other races toward ones own race, and ones own race expectation 
(vocabulary of behaviors accepted as understood even though hidden, towards 
others not of ones own race), etc..). &quot;All races&quot; do this. ANd there are 
always exceptions to this racism. &quot;Well, X feels that way about Y, but YOU 
are different and X doesnt feel that way about YOU (X and Y being of 
different races and YOU being of race Y b/c of a more personal level 
experience).</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>That includes African towards Caucasion, Caucasion towards African, African 
towards Chinese or Koreans, Japanese towards Chinese, Chinese toward 
Japanese.. on and on ... Perhaps they justify this 'hidden and adopted 
emotional impulse' WITHIN thier 'spiritual' seekings BEFORE they recognise 
it. The death in it is perhaps best exemplified by those that KNOWINGLY 
incorporate it into their spiritual belief system.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>On a persons personal level a reflection of the larger motivation :<br>
I believe it may be akin to the phase many go through when becoming more 
self aware and romanticize the 'seperation of themselves from the mundane 
(others)'. I believe its really an immature (and sometimes perverted from 
their own angst, anger, pregudices, etc.) attempt to more fully experience 
the new phenomenon.. they muist seperate it from the mundane normal 
experience to experience it more fully and more 'raw'.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>not b/c they FEEL OR believe they are 'superior'...<br>
more b/c they are about to come face-to-face with the opportunity to master 
their own &quot;Spirit of Vanity&quot;... and eventually HOPEFULLY see it, and 
transmute it to some degree. (emotionally they may wrestle with this FEELING 
inside mentally knowing its silly and vain, but emotionally FEELING it 
anyway., etc. unti integrated and resolved and transmuted)</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>RACE LEVEL:<br>
How long should it take a &quot;race&quot; to come face-to-face with its own &quot;Spirit 
of Vanity and Pride&quot; in its desire to reflect upon itself as different, 
special and unique USING another race as its mirror of seperation? Getting 
through the dross of perversion to the truth? God only knows. How long will 
it take each of us? What happens after that? In truth, we are probably ALL 
still approaching that truth.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Racism hurts. I have experienced it as well. Seeing that a persons heart is 
usually hidden from their own awareness, its often far more joyful to love 
them within their darkness and ignorance... more truely Love in action and 
w/o conditions. A wonderful opportunity to resolve our own fears and hurts 
and lessen our attatchments to THIER racist reactions and ignorance, as well 
as our own in reaction to our experiences with theirs.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Is it any less racist to further the racism of others be adding to our own 
belief in our own expectations and attachments to the hurt? Perhaps it would 
be far more profitable to address the source of the hurt within ourselves.. 
and love the racist (and I think that was your original email suggestion)</tt><br>
