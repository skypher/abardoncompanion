&quot;Self Worth.&quot;
Hmmm, this is an extremely difficult one. I wish there were a koan 
or a simple technique to cause you to slip and catch your balance 
and with catching your balance came with it a solid sense of self-
worth. I wish it were that easy. 

I can also see how you would want to try one thing and then another 
until you happened on something that held some form of your self 
worth up higher than usual, or some thing that gave you a boost. But 
unfortunately nothing will build your self confidence better and 
quicker in the long run than beginning with the basic building 
blocks and seeing a solid foundation laid down for yourself. And 
that would be to take on IIH Lesson 1 or Lomer's Letter 1 lessons 
head on, full force. (Lomer's 7Letters is available as a text 
download in the files section here I think).

I could give you a starting point if you would like, which helped me 
at the beginning. These actually come from some yoga techniques from 
years past for me.

Lift up the glass or mug, or pencil in front of you. (Pat yourself 
on the back for picking up the pencil/mug/glass and moving it to 
this position). Watch the object you are holding intently. Not 
intensely, but intently which means to give it your full attention, 
but don't strain. Move your hand holding the object to in front of 
your face at eye level, as far out as comfortable. Watch the object 
for as long as comfortable without moving the head. (pat yourself on 
the back for doing this much). Move your hand right next to your 
head, to your temple, in front of your ear, stop. (Pat yourself on 
the back for doing these things so far). 

Do this over again, do it about 3 or 4 times.

Relax, rest the object back in front of you, and relax your 
hands/arms. (Pat yourself on the back for doing this so far).

Now close your eyes and &quot;imagine&quot; your hand picking up the object 
and going through the same movements.

Relax.

Now just relax and let your train of thoughts continue on by 
themselves. This is the meat of the exercise. This is part one of 
Lesson 1 of IIH. Do not stop on any one thought or let any one 
thought attract more attention. This is another/different exercise.

By the way, each time you patted yourself on the back you were 
reaffirming your self worth. It is REALLY that simple.

Also in impregnating your breath with a thought ideation, make that 
thought the feeling of what you would feel like if you had a drop 
more of self worth than you currently have.

Impregnate your water you wash with with this same thought. 
Impregnate your shower water with the thought of washing off low 
self worth. Take into your sleep the last waking thought; my self 
worth increases by one drop each day.








&gt; Hello Chuck,
\ So in the meantime I would still welcome any answers to the 
&gt; specific questions I asked, more as a confirmation to what I think 
&gt; I've figured out than anything else.
&gt; 

For myself, in the Center of Stillness exercises I have found great 
joy in affirming in the center of the stillness that God is one. All 
is God. I and my father are one. And let myself 'feel' the oneness, 
or my God/man-hood. This is actually where I allowed this sense to 
solidify as a firm belief in myself.

Using the YHVH-ADNI exercises I found great peace in solidifying the 
assurance that my feeling/thought ideations were in fact reaching 
out into encompassing the universe as ripples on top of the water of 
a calm lake.

Well, I've only a couple of minutes to write. I enjoy everyones' 
examples and sharing, so felt I should do some on this topic now 
also.

I wish you all well
And relax, David, using the Bardon technique will do everything you 
hope from it, just keep at it.

Chuck
