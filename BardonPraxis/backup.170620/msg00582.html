<pre>UNIFICATION



At this very moment that I begin to write, the sun, having finished with the 
sign of Pisces, is entering the zodiacal sign of Aries, the Ram. The last 
degree of Pisces is aptly symbolized by its Sabian symbol: &quot;A seer's dream now 
lives: a face carved into huge rocks.&quot; To my mind this reflects the sense of 
finality that recent world events bring to our collective consciousness. That 
sense of an anticipated fate's arrival, too late to avoid or substantially 
change once here. For most of us, these world events engender a sense of 
powerlessness; of our individual smallness and inability to make these events 
go the way *we* want them to. For many of us, our response to our individual 
powerlessness is to seek out a collective sense of power, be that through 
gathering in the streets, in our places of worship or in our own homes, friend 
to friend. Some have recently even discussed the use of magical spells, be they 
individual or collective, in search of a greater source of power to counter 
this awareness of our individual powerlessness.

It is my purpose in writing now, as the sun enters the first degree of Aries 
and the new solar year begins, to invite your participation in an on-going 
magical unification of consciousness. The focus of this work is to unite in the 
spirit of Loving Kindness and thereby energize our collective Alikeness. Our 
deeper commonality, which surpasses and underlies all differences of belief, 
bias and physical circumstance, is a powerful force which, while it cannot 
reshape our past, it *CAN* shape our eventual future. The future always was and 
always will be within *OUR* collective hands to shape . . .

The Sabian Symbol for the first degree of Aries is: &quot;A woman has risen from the 
ocean; a seal embraces her.&quot; This symbol expresses an emergence from mundane 
differences and an embracing of 'other' at a higher level of commonality. And 
this is the essence of the method of participation that I wish to suggest. By 
following this method you will be able to directly participate in the global 
effort to make the Merciful spirit of Loving Kindness a manifest reality.

The technique I will describe encompasses several possible levels of 
participation. Your degree of participation will hinge upon your facility with 
navigating the levels of consciousness available to every living being. The 
first level is the interpersonal, face to face with another living being, 
level. Second is the Individual-to-Individual level, where one must attain the 
&quot;Tiphareth perspective&quot; and engage consciously with other Individual Selves at 
that level. Third is the level of the Greater or Binah Self in which one rises 
to their Greater level of awareness and interacts with other Greater Selves at 
that level. And finally, is the level of The Unity ItSelf.

The point of this is twofold: unification AND the integration of Loving 
Kindness into the mundane realm. The unification that occurs at higher states 
of consciousness than the mundane, personal level, is subsequently integrated 
into each Individual's personal, mundane consciousness. It's this *conscious* 
descent of a collective Loving Kindness into the physical present moment that 
gives this meditation ritual its magical power.

If you are unfamiliar with the concepts of Individual and Greater Self, then I 
suggest that you read the following references/explanations available on my 
website.

Without further ado, here follows the technique itself.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


COLLECTIVE UNIFICATION THROUGH LOVING KINDNESS:



Sit comfortably in front of another living being. It can be another human 
being, a plant or animal -- the important thing is that it be a living being. 
Look closely at this other being and notice all of the differences between you. 
Differences in form, in life circumstances, in thoughts and ideals, in past and 
future. *SEE* this other being as they are and be aware that you are being seen 
in return. 

Now shift your examination to the similarities that you share with this other 
being. Focus especially upon the fact that you both exist here and now. Out of 
the whole infinite span of time and space, here you sit, face to face, one 
being examining another. You occupy the same moment in time and nearly the same 
point in space and you are both conscious of this fact. 

Open your heart and mind to a deep compassion for this other being and 
simultaneously sense yourself surrounded by the same force of Loving Kindness 
emanating from this other. Feel this force of Loving Kindness binding the two 
of you together via the threads of commonality that exist between you. 

Now, if you are able, rise up to the awareness of your Individual Self. Focus 
intensively upon this perspective and its concomitant sense of detachment from 
the mundane circumstances of your corporeal existence. Observe how petty these 
circumstances are from this perspective and how transitory the differences 
between one person and another truly are in the grander scheme of things. 

Now turn your focus upon the Individual Self of the other being and observe it 
in the same manner as you did its personal, material form. See the differences 
that exist and which make you each unique. And now observe the similarities 
that bind you, especially the fact that you are both here and now, observing 
each other consciously. 

Now open your heart and mind to a deep compassion for this other Individual and 
simultaneously sense yourself surrounded by the same force of Loving Kindness 
emanating from this other. Feel this force of Loving Kindness binding the two 
of you together via the threads of commonality that exist between you.

Become aware of your physical selves sitting face to face and sharing this same 
bond of Loving Kindness. You both exist simultaneously in the same physical 
time and space as well as this same mental time and place, and you are both 
conscious of this fact.

Now look outward and sense the countless other Individual Selves who populate 
this mental time and place. See them just as you've seen the other being 
sitting before you. Note the differences between you which define you each as 
discrete Individuals and then observe the similarities which bind you together.

Now expand the deep compassion flowing from your heart and mind until it 
encompasses all of the other Individuals that you perceive and simultaneously 
sense yourself surrounded by the same force of Loving Kindness emanating from 
these others. Feel this force of Loving Kindness binding the lot of you 
together via the threads of commonality that exist between you all.

Again become aware of your physical selves existing on the same planet earth 
and sharing this same bond of Loving Kindness. You all exist simultaneously in 
the same physical time and space as well as this same mental time and place, 
and you are all conscious of this fact.

Now, if you are able, abandon the constraints of time and space and rise up to 
the awareness of your Greater Self. Focus intensively upon this perspective and 
its concomitant sense of timeless Understanding. Observe the infinite flow of 
temporal events and bask in the Understanding of their ultimate rightness. See 
how the horrors of the past, present and future are all one. Understand and 
Know that All is connected and part of The One Thing.

Observe the other Greaters who surround you and consciously acknowledge them. 
Bathe them all in the force of Loving Kindness and together bless the entire 
temporal realm with this same force of Loving Kindness. Face the Greater Self 
of the other being you sit face to face with in the physical realm and deepen 
the bond of Loving Kindness between the two of you. If perchance you find that 
you exist as Individual parts of the same Greater Self, then bask in the joy of 
your mutual awareness.

Now become aware of your Individual Selves, face to face and sharing this same 
bond of Loving Kindness. You both exist simultaneously in the same mental time 
and place, as well as this eternal joining, and you are both conscious of this 
fact. Hold this simultaneous awareness of the Greater and Individual levels of 
your awareness and become aware of your physical selves existing on the same 
planet earth and sharing this same bond of Loving Kindness. You exist 
simultaneously in the same physical time and space, the same mental time and 
place, as well as this eternal joining, and you are both conscious of this fact.

And now, if you are able, arise together into the Unity of The One Self. Focus 
intensively upon this perspective and its concomitant sense of All Knowing, All 
Understanding and All Wisdom. Experience The Whole and BE Loving Kindness. 
Become particularly aware of the Greater, Individual and personal levels of 
Self and carry the Force of Loving Kindness all the way down into the temporal 
moment of sitting face to face with another living being. In this way, bind the 
*conscious* awareness of The Unity with the Greater, Individual and material 
levels of Self, all the way down to the infinitely finite present moment of 
physical time and space.



When you are done, return to your normal waking consciousness, and focus your 
awareness into your physical body. Look out of your eyes at the other being who 
sits in front of you and become aware of the levels at which you share 
commonality with this other being. Again project and simultaneously receive the 
force of Loving Kindness here, at this material level. Take this feeling with 
you as you go about your business and spread it likewise to every other being 
you encounter.


My love to you all,
:) Rawn Clark
