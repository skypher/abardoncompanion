Rawn,


&gt; It does concern me that this discussion has centered so much around
&gt; 'what if's and around what *others* *might* encounter but not about
&gt; *your* own experience of these matters. 

ok . fair enough :-)
I *thought* I was on topic :-)
I guess this does reflect my experience in a way . 
But that is a long story .Suffice to say that when i created my mirror
with &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad &quot; attributes , with the &quot;good&quot; and&quot;bad&quot; coming
from social conditioning and &quot;socially accepted&quot; mores, i found
myself striving to become someone *I* didn't want to be . The &quot;how
*you* feel and think is good &quot; meme , in one of Rawn's earlier mails
struck a chord and hence my posts .
One simple example is an item on my mirror &quot;Pride&quot; . I plonked this
into the &quot;black&quot; mirror and intended to work towards being &quot;humble&quot;
(culturally pride = bad, humility == good ).On reflection, i find
there are TWO kinds of hunility , one of being humble because you
*know* (not think... know) that however high your achievements, there
are people better than you and you always have more to do and become(i
call this humility based on *perception* ) and the other is being
humble because that is &quot;good&quot; (i call this humility based on a notion
of &quot;goodness&quot; ).In *my* world the former is different from the
latter. Suffice to say i encountered tremendous resistance trying to
be &quot;nice&quot; (which is what i equated &quot;positive&quot; to) . I am now redoing
my mirror based on who and what *I* want to become .

I guess in a nutshell, i find that many of my mirror items are
misclassified and the &quot;bad&quot; items have components of&quot;good&quot; and vice
versa .Now my mirror is looking very different , and many of my
&quot;positives&quot; and &quot;negatives&quot; don't look anything like my &quot;culture
sanctioned&quot; values . I guess there is still some residual confusion
there . Aplogies if any of this was rather fuzzily expressed .



&gt; What did you think Bardon's listing of the positive and negative
&gt; characteristics was about if not a *universal* statement of positive
&gt; BEing? 

Ahhh but i thought we should NOT rely on BArdon's charactersitics
?What i found out after a long struggle to be &quot;good&quot; was that each of
these characteristics , say &quot;humility&quot; looked very different to me
than what is &quot;commonly&quot; accpeted as its meaning. maybe i would have
saved a lot of time and effort if i had figured this out earlier .

&gt; How *you* feel *inside* is not rooted in your culture. It is *modified*
&gt; by your culture, but the root is in *you* (i.e., the Individual Self).

ok . i need to think on this further .


&gt; &gt;&gt; b)the 'real world effectiveness' problem &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; I don't understand what you're trying to say here. If you think that
&gt; the character transformation work is &quot;fluffy bunny&quot; or leads in some way
&gt; to &quot;fluffy bunnyness&quot; then it is clear you are not talking from
&gt; practical experience. I suggest that you focus on practice and see for
&gt; yourself. The character transformation work anchors you very clearly in
&gt; THIS world. :)

ok sorry rawn :) i guess i was just angry at the notion that virtue==
&quot;goodness&quot; concept . i often found myself trying to be &quot;humble&quot;
magnanimous&quot; etc and feeling and being very ineffective in real world
situations consequently . I was just trying to make the point that
with mirror work one should become MORE effective not less in the
physical world and if not there is something wrong . I am sure it is
blindingly obvious to lots of people. :-|


&gt; If this is what you *think* then try it out and see if it *works*. :)
&gt; All of your speculations about what might or might not be possible have
&gt; yet to be tested through experience. Hermetic *initiation* (as opposed
&gt; to the intellectual study and speculation) is founded upon *your*
&gt; *experience*.

Makes PERFECT sense !! 

Thanks again,
ravi
