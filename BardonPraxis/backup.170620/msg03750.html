<pre>Dear Stephanie,

&gt;&gt; 1. Impregnation of a desire into food/drink. Bardon says that the
more abstract the thought the better, &lt;&lt;

No, he did not say this. I recommend that you re-read what he wrote in
that regard, very carefully.

&gt;&gt; would I be better to concentrate on a particular quality such as
attention or visualization or vacancy of mind &lt;&lt;

Yes, the Eucharistic magics are best applied to forwarding your progress
with the IIH exercises. In fact, these techniques are used extensively
in the Step Two and Three character transformation work.

&gt;&gt; How long would you say is *too* long! &lt;&lt;

You are the only one to judge that.

&gt;&gt; And if you do begin to see results from a desire, should you carry on
with that desire until you have completely accomplished it, or is it OK
to move to another desire once you see that the first desire is
beginning to take effect? &lt;&lt;

As Bardon wrote: &quot;In any case, you should not proceed to the imagination
of another, different desire before the chosen one has been *completely*
accomplished.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Another question on impregnation of food &amp; drink: When I hold my
hands over the food or drink, I can feel the energy going through my
whole body and down my hands into the food, filling it up with my
desire. If I am around people and can't do this, I still imagine my
desire going into the food and drink but can't actually feel anything.
Is this something that will come with time, or am I doing something
wrong? &lt;&lt;

See <a  href="../EMMisc.html">http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/EMMisc.html</a>

&gt;&gt; 2. Eliminating undesirable qualities. As above, is it better to be
abstract such as &quot;all my black mirror qualities are being washed away&quot;,
or more precise such as &quot;mind chatter is being washed away&quot;? &lt;&lt;

It is better to be precise with the Eucharistic magics.

&gt;&gt; 3. The elements. Would it be helpful instead of impregnating food
and drink with a desire, to instead impregnate it with the positive
aspects of a particular element, eg to visualize or imagine only
positive energy of one element coming into your food, dissolving the
negative aspects of that particular element at the same time? Or am I
completely off track here? &lt;&lt;

If you are sincere in your desire to make progress in IIH then my
recommendation is that you do as Bardon instructed and master each
exercise the way he wrote them *before* you consider modifying them in
any way.

&gt;&gt; 4. Vacancy of mind. &lt;&lt;

I suggest that you search my website for these answers and/or search the
BardonPraxis archive.

&gt;&gt; 5. Visualization and control of the senses. I understand from Rawn's
site and correspondence excerpts that it is not necessary to literally
see something, as long as you can hold the minds-eye image. Is this the
same for the hearing, smelling, tasting &amp; touch exercises? &lt;&lt;

Yes.

&gt;&gt; If so, some clarification on this would be really helpful. &lt;&lt;

This will clarify itself when you begin working with those exercises.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
