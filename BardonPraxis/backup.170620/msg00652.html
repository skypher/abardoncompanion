<pre>&quot;Spontaneous Magic&quot;
by Rawn Clark
&#xA9; 12 April 2003

This afternoon, it's raining heavily, keeping me out of the garden where
I'd rather be. :) Forced indoors instead of out, I decided to tend to
my indoor plants, giving them all a good watering and some loving. One
plant in particular needed a fair bit more than just water and love
though. My poor &quot;Jade Tree&quot; plant has been suffering from over-Winter
apartment life for a while now was in definite need of a Spring
sprucing!

First thing he needed was to be cut way back. After trimming him beyond
recognition, I placed him in the sunniest spot of my south facing
window. But still he needed more. He needed a bit of magical aid to
once again thrive.

What follows in a telling of the spontaneous magical ritual that
resulted. I'm relating this experience to illustrate one instance of
how the techniques learned in IIH can be applied to a random situation
and employed in a spontaneous, intuitive manner. My ritual also
includes advanced aspects of The Magic of IHVH-ADNI which extend
somewhat beyond what I introduced in the final Lesson Six of that work.

*******************************
I began with the application of my &quot;Fire Hand&quot;[1], held over each
individual cut stem. This very quickly dries the cut ends, thus
stopping up the seeping juices that had been flowing steadily until that
moment. The cut ends began to heal themselves in the presence of so
much Fire Element.

Then I rotated my Fire Hand over the whole pot to energize the soil,
roots and remainder of the plants. The whole became infused with a
quantity of the Fire Element which I then set to motion in a clockwise
direction.

The image of a specific stone came into my mind and I intuitively knew
that this stone needed to be in the pot with my Jade Tree. So I found
the stone and placed him to one side of the pot. This was to be the
guardian who overlooks the healing process. I filled this stone with
the Akasha and created sufficient causation by impregnating the Akasha
with the purpose of healing the Jade Tree.

Then I understood that a specific piece of Quartz crystal was needed to
complete the energetics of the situation and to help diffuse the
causation materially. I located the crystal and placed it within the
pot, opposite the stone.

I employed my Fire hand again over the plants at cut ends, over the
stone and then over the crystal. I transferred a strong accumulation of
the Fire Element into the crystal.

Then I switched to the Air Hand[2] and transferred an equal accumulation
of the Air Element into the crystal. This was followed by the use of
Water Hand and the transference of an accumulation of Water, and then
Earth Hand to complete a transference of an accumulation of the Earth
Element. These accumulations will serve as the raw material for the
plants to draw upon in their healing and further growth -- the magical
equivalent of fertilizer.

Then I filled the crystal with the Akasha as well, giving it life and
purpose.

To finish this phase, I rotated my Fire Hand over the whole pot and set
the energetics of the whole into clockwise motion. I announced, &quot;So
mote it be!&quot;

The second phase of my healing ritual took the form of a Wiccan canticle
that I learned many years ago. It's a simple purification ritual, tied
to a simple phrase.

&quot;I cast out all negativity[3] and in its place, let harmony be![4] I
now invoke the law of three[5] . . . And as I will, so mote it be!&quot;[6]

For the third and final phase of my ritual, I employed The Magic of
IHVH-ADNI. I merged awareness with plants, soil, pot, crystal and
stone, en mass, and together performed the Magic of IHVH-ADNI

&quot;Ani&quot; -- and we are The Unity.

&quot;Yod&quot; -- and we are the crux of Chokmah.

&quot;Heh&quot; -- and we are each our Binah Greater Selves, face to face.

&quot;Vav&quot; -- and we are each our Individual Selves, standing together.

&quot;Heh&quot; -- and we are each our physical selves, sharing this moment in
space and time.

&quot;Adonai&quot; -- and we are the swirling rainbow-hued force that naturally
arises when all of these levels of our BEing -- material, Individual,
Greater and Unity -- are consciously united at once.

&quot;Ribonno Shel Olam&quot; -- and we fling this materialized force upward, unto
Keter and outwards, unto the edges of infinity.

&quot;Amen&quot; -- and our awareness draws inward from the Unitary, to the
Greater, to the Individual and finally, upon the completion of the
&quot;Amen&quot;, to the material, and the rainbow-hued light, transfixed by its
journey, surrounds us.

And finally, to assure our continued vibrancy and harmonization with the
universe, with the next inhale we drawn the clockwise spiral of this
energy, inward to our physical core and the with the exhale we fling it
outward, following a clockwise spiral, into the substance of this moment
in the temporal universe. It radiates to the very edges of the physical
moment and returns with the inhale. With the next exhale we repeat this
sending outward into the temporal universe, this time adding our
blessings to the energy. And again, with the inhale we draw this energy
back into our core, always rotating it with a clockwise spiral motion.
And for a final, third time, we send this energy out, into the substance
of this moment in the temporal universe, and observe[7] as our blessing
upon this moment is made manifest. With the final inhale, we draw this
energy back to ourselves and let it swirl around us.

&quot;Amen&quot; -- and we are once again separate physical objects, standing in
close proximity, sharing this moment in time.

*******************************
Notes:
[1] By &quot;Fire Hand&quot;, I mean that within my right hand there is an intense
accumulation of the Fire Element, which I project through the palm of my
cupped hand.
[2] &quot;Air Hand&quot; is similar to Fire Hand except that it is filled with an
intense accumulation of the Air Element. Water and Earth Hands
likewise, indicate an accumulation of their respective Elements.
[3] Here I perform a simple visualized banishing of all negativity from
the pot, plant, stone and crystal.
[4] And here I visualize the settling of the whole into an harmonious
state of being.
[5] At which point I perceived the harmony of the whole at its mental
level, then its astral level, and then its physical level. By
&quot;perceived&quot; here, I mean a form of creative visualization that is backed
by such certainty and force of will, that it immediately manifests as
fact. Thus the visualization and the perception of its actualization
are nearly simultaneous.
[6] At which point I perceived Keter, then Chokmah, then Binah, then
Tiphareth, then Malkuth, and thus made it so.
[7] This &quot;observation&quot; is the same as the creative perception mentioned
in note 5.
