<pre>Dear 'FraterQV',

&gt;&gt; Bardon never really gave a good definition of what &quot;akasha&quot; is.
There are several different meanings depending on which mystical/magical
school you are talking about. If anyone can quote Bardon's
comments/definition on &quot;akasha,&quot; I would really love to hear it. &lt;&lt;

Okay. :) Bardon actually wrote quite a bit about the Akasha and thanks
to the digital versions of his works that are available (except for
&quot;Questions and Answers&quot;), here are all of his most relevant comments
describing the Akasha:

&gt;From &quot;Initiation Into Hermetics&quot; --

1) Several times while describing the elements I have said that they
proceed from the ethereal principle. Accordingly, the ethereal principle
is the ultimate, the supreme, the most powerful thing, something
inconceivable, the ultimate cause of all things existing and created. To
put it in a nutshell, it is the causal sphere. Therefore akasa is
spaceless and timeless. It is the non-created, the incomprehensible, the
indefinable. The various religions have given it the name of God. It is
the fifth power, the original power. Everything has been created by it
and is kept in balance by it. It is the origin and the purity of all
thoughts and intentions, it is the causal world wherein the whole
creation in subsisting on, beginning from the highest spheres down to
the lowest ones. It is the quintessence of the alchemists; it is all in
all.


2) Now the question will arise were and how akasa or the etheric
principle occurs in the grossly material body. In doing some deeper
thinking, everybody will be able to answer this question by himself, for
the etheric principle is hidden in its most grossly material form in the
blood and in the seed and in the reciprocal action of these two
substances in the vital matter or in the vitality.


3) The material world has emerged from the principle of akasa, i.e.,
the known ether. The world also is controlled and kept by this same
principle.


4) Through subtler vibrations of the elements, through the electric and
the magnetic fluid of their polarity, the man proper, the soul has
proceeded from the akasa principle or the finer etheric vibrations.


5) The centre of the ether or principle of akasa is found in the region
of the neck and is named Visudha.


6) Beginning at the top, from the supreme centre, along the neck, down
to the lowest centre, like a channel runs the socalled Susumna or the
akasa-principle already known to us, liable for the connection and
control of the entire centres.


7) The astral plane, often designated as the fourth dimension, has not
been created out of the four elements, but it is a density-degree of the
akasa principle, consequently of all that up to now, in the material
world occurred, is actually occurring and will occur, and has its
origin, regulation and existence. As said before, akasa in its most
subtle form is the ether, well known to all of us, in which, amongst
other vibrations, electric as well as magnetic ones are propagating.
Consequently this vibration-sphere is the origin of light, sound, colour
, rhythm, and life in all things created. As akasa is the origin of all
existing things, all that ever was produced, is being produced and will
be produced in the future is reflected in it. Therefore, in the astral
plane there is to be seen an emanation of the eternal, having neither a
beginning nor an end, as it is timeless and spaceless.


8) From the supreme prototype (akasa), the original source of all
beings, has proceeded the spirit, the spiritual EGO with the four
specific elemental qualities, proper to the immortal spirit, which was
created in God's image.


9) All the other qualities of the spirit are based upon these four
original principles. The typical part of the fifth, say the etheric
principle (akasa) manifests itself, in the highest aspect, in the faith
and, in the lowest form, in the instinct of self-preservation.


10) Both these spheres, the material as well as the astral one have
been born from the akasa or original principle of the respective sphere,
through the four elements, and also the mental sphere is built upon the
same foundation, and therefore likewise a product of the akasa principle
of the spirit. Similar to the spirit, developing in a fourpole magnet by
corresponding work and showing an electromagnetic fluid analogous to
the astral body, on account of the effect of the elements, as a
secondary phenomenon of the polarity on the outside, the mental body
develops in the mental or spiritual sphere. Just in the same way as the
astral body, through the electromagnetic fluid of the astral world,
forms an astral matrix, the so-called astral od, the electromagnetic
fluid of the mental world forms a mental matrix linking the mental body
to the astral body. This mental matrix or the mental od, the so-called
mental substance, is the subtlest form of akasa which controls and
preserves the spiritual activity in the astral body.


11) Simultaneously, the mental sphere is the sphere of thoughts which
have their origin in the world of ideas, consequently in the spiritual
akasa. Each thought is preceded by a basic idea which, according to its
property, accepts a definite form, and arrives to the consciousness of
the ego through the etheric principle, consequently the mental matrix,
as expression of the thought in the shape of a plastic picture.
Therefore Man himself is not the founder of the thoughts, but the origin
of each thought is to be sought in the supreme akasa sphere or the
mental plane.


12) Working in the akasa principle is timeless and spaceless; in the
mental sphere, you operate with time; in the astral sphere, you work
with space (shape, colour); in the material world, you work with time
and space simultaneously.


13) Consciousness knows neither time nor space; it is consequently an
akasa-principle.


14) This mental balance is the specific fundamental property of the
akasa or causal principle of the mind.


15) Working through this step the scholar should be able to transfer
himself at any hour and in every situation into this depthpoint, into
the akasa principle, from there perceiving and influencing all that
concerns his being. This consciousness transference into the akasa
principle is the genuine magical state of trance and represents the
preliminary stage of the connection with the cosmic consciousness.


16) We have heard that akasa is the primary source, the sphere of all
causes. Any deliberate cause, such as a wish, a thought, any imagination
created in this sphere together with the dynamic conviction is bound to
be realized with the help of the elements, regardless of the level or
sphere on which the realization necessarily has to be performed. This is
one of the greatest magic mysteries and a universal key for the
magician, who will understand its range only later on in the course of
his development. The scholar should always keep his mind on his own
ethical development, which will certainly help him to do only good and
noble deeds. Our next exercise will be to win absolute control of the
elements with the help of the akasa principle in all the three realms.


17) The akasa principle, in its simplest form expresses itself as
conscience.


18)
Element: Fire Air Water Earth Akasa
Sense: Eyes Ears Perception Taste/Smell All in all
Quality: Will Intellect Feeling Consciousness Conscience
Exercise: Optic Acoustic Emotional Expand consc. Realization


19) Now load your right hand with akasa, which you imagine to be of a
black- violet colour.


20) A magician has got to be kind, obliging and willing to help at any
time, to assist by word and deed, to act generously, considerately and
discretely. He must be free from ambition, superciliousness and avoid
any boasting. All such passions would be reflected in the akasa and, the
akasa principle being analogous to harmony, akasa itself would certainly
put the greatest obstacles in the magician's way to stop his further
development, if not make it quite impossible. Any further rising in a
case like that would be quite out of question. Just remember Bulwer's
novel Zanoni, in which the guardian of the threshold, nothing else but
akasa, sees that the highest mysteries do not come overnight to unworthy
people. Akasa will derange a person mentally, arouse doubts of all
kinds, or hold him prisoner by vicissitudes and reverses of fortune in
order to protect the mysteries in every possible way. These mysteries
will always remain hidden from incompetent persons, though hundreds of
books should be published about them.


21) Since the akasa principle ignores time and space, acting
permanently in the present time, for the concept of time depends on our
senses, the magician is advised to adapt himself as much as possible to
akasa. He must acknowledge the great moment of NOW as representative,
thinking and acting according to it.


&gt;From &quot;Key to the True Quabbalah&quot; --

22) The sun in the center of the picture represents Divine Providence,
the Akasa Principle, the origin of all that exists.


23) The &quot;Ch&quot; has a violet color oscillation and thus appertains to the
akasa principle


24) The &quot;E&quot;, in a dark violet color, akasa violet, light oscillation.
The &quot;E&quot; has the specific characteristic of the akasa principle which is
revealed, in its elemental effect, in a feeling of power of penetrating
all.


25) This number is graphically symbolized by a triangle. The three is
the number of akasa principle, of fate, of karma, and, planetarily seen,
the three is attributed to the sphere of Saturn. Everything that was,
that is and that will be, the mental as well as the astral and the
material, originates from the akasa principle, wherein the three is also
to be found. Number three is the original idea of procreation, which
manifests itself in the plus and the minus, i.e., in man and woman who,
in unification, beget the third, i.e., the child. In man himself, the
three is represented by spirit, soul and body. The three is also the
number of intuition. All religious systems, in their fateful
manifestation, have derived from this number. Three is the number of
life and death. It is the number of cognition in its highest form.


&gt;From &quot;Practice of Magical Evocation --

26) The Akasha Principle of the astral sphere maintains the harmonious
equilibrium of the elements in the entire astral sphere.


27) The magician also has another opportunity: he can symbolize the
elements in the circle, in which particular case he only has to place
four lamps inside the magic circle. The magician who stands in the
center of the magic circle is the representative of the Akasha Principle
and as such he represents the fifth element.


&gt;From &quot;Questions &amp; Answers&quot; --

28-54) The last 10 pages (from page 88 onward) are devoted to comments
pertaining to the Akasha.

My best to you,
