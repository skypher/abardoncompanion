<pre>Dear NB,

The worst for myself was to realize that not only I was sleeping but 
everything I believe I experienced was indeed fake, and with no 
consciousness of what is really happening. 

All my feelings, opinions, and events that I perceived from my life 
were created by paterns and beliefs generated from my reaction to 
past experiences; these feelings, opinions and actions originated 
themselves other situations &amp; experiences. It is like a never ending 
circle and there is no Truth in it, moreover, there was no 
consciousness of it. 
Indeed, the only Truth arise from very difficult personal experiences 
which happen as a results of previous choices with a clear pattern of 
making the same wrong choices over and over. 
These difficult momments and periods of time were ultimately very 
beneficial experiences in a way that I experience &quot;I AM&quot;, and this 
consciousness and blessing is with me since then, at least the memory 
of it.

And now, I keep on walking in the path of life in a state of deep 
coma with a spark of consciousness which popps up sometimes.

YES, this is the common human experience crossing the life in such a 
state of deep coma. This is a world for sleeping. 

Love and Light 

Pierre Mikael

&gt; This evening, after having worked on my mirror, I suddenly realized 
&gt; that I was used of spending most of my time being idle, not focused 
&gt; on anything, a bit like a bottle's cork (don't know the correct 
&gt; wording) floating at the surface of water. Days long. 
&gt; ...The opposite of the thought discipline exercise in level 1 IIH, 
&gt; that I considered as having completed, as far as the first contact 
&gt; was concerned.
&gt; 
&gt; I also realized a few other things, which didn't exactly consolate 
&gt; me :
&gt; 
&gt; a) I have been able to keep myself in this state during *my whole 
&gt; life* because the level of real permanent awareness required by my 
&gt; daily activities was fairly low. IIH not included :-)
&gt; 
&gt; b) When situations required my full awareness for a long time, my 
&gt; failure (if any) was considered as a lack of skills - not as the 
&gt; punition of a sleeping newbie.
&gt; 
&gt; c) What I considered as mental activities or as work was actually 
&gt; islands within an ocean of idleness.
&gt; 
&gt; d) A good portion of my mind was actually sleeping ...and probably 
&gt; dreaming - hence my problems with mind chatting, probably.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know whether this sudden &quot;clairvoyance&quot; comes from my 
&gt; renewed practice of IIH level 1-2 or because I started using 
&gt; spagyric mixtures containing &quot;Euphrasia Officinalis&quot; :-) but I must 
&gt; say it's a bit of a shock.
&gt; 
&gt; Did anybody realize the same thing, or am I telling me stories 
&gt; again ?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers :-(
&gt; 
&gt; NB
