<pre>Greetings!

It amazes me the amount of what I call &quot;little wonders&quot; results from 
daily practice of IIH. 

For instance, the side-effects of wish-impregnation. Whereas I would 
have to endure places before that had negative &quot;vibes&quot;, now I just 
change the area through wish-impregnation of the air with whatever 
vibe-ideation I wish it to have. I've caught myself doing this like 
it was second nature, or something that I've always known how to do 
(although obviously I haven't).

Another thing in relation to impregnation, is that nowadays 
locations &quot;speak&quot; to me. I really don't know what better way to put 
it. Places, things, and people &quot;speak&quot; to me through the vibe they 
give me. The whole vibe thing is like a two-way communication with my 
surroundings and myself. Everything is _alive_!

This might sound insane, but it seemed quite logical when it happened 
this morning: I was entering the building where I work, which has 
this great entrance-hall. It communicated to me &quot;I am majestic and my 
purpose is to be majestic; but my roof could/should be reconstructed 
to make me look more majestic!&quot;. Since I now know how it feels to 
_project_ ideations from myself, I can also tell when they don't 
originate from me; I can honestly say that the location _itself_ 
projected the ideation I just described. Freaky, huh?!

Nowhere have I read that the practice of IIH would lead to results 
like this... and I am only just beginning on Step II!!!

Another thing is conscious breathing; I find myself doing this almost 
throughout the whole day, whenever I am not occupied with any other 
mental thoughts (such as when walking, waiting for something, etc). 
It is also like second-nature, and manifests itself naturally 
whenever the negative counterpart of its current wish/topic rears its 
ugly head like a trigger.

I wonder if anyone has any thoughts regarding consequences of 
practice such as these?


Finally, I have a question regarding Step II concentration on smell 
(olfactory) exercises. While visual concentration is easy to 
understand, since its medium is constant input, I have problems 
figuring out how I am going to perform the olfactory exercises. Since 
smell is dependant upon inhalation through the nose, wouldn't it be 
very difficult to simulate a constant concentration on smell? Does 
anyone have any advice on this matter? I hope I've made the question 
comprehensible.

Thanx for your patience!

Well met
Vovin
