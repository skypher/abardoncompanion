<pre style="margin: 0em;">Greetings all,</pre><br>
<tt>Rawn responded to the query:
</tt><blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">&gt;&gt; Also what about sharing food or drinks (I have a partner). Bardon
absolutely advises against leaving anything unconsumed that has been
charged. How does this apply to other people eating your charged
comestibles? &lt;&lt;</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Part of building the intention here is that you treat the food that
you've charged as special. This means that no one else should consume
it while it is charged. If you have left-overs, then remove what charge
remains in them before disposing of them or sharing them with others.
If your partner regularly eats a portion of your food, then set aside
this portion and don't charge it. Charge only the portion that you will
be consuming.
</pre></blockquote><tt><br>When I would make jams and preserves, back when we had an orchard, I was in 
the habit of enchanting the whole batch with Universal Love. I would stay 
very focused upon my intent throughout the process, and added meaningful 
gestures, etc. I took great care with these products, so that they would be 
very special. I even polished the jars so that they would sparkle with the 
inner light. Everyone who ate the jams at my table, would close their eyes 
and smile as if they had just been kissed. That was my sole intent - that 
whosoever partook of the magickal jam, would feel the love of the Universe. 
Nothing more. All said my jams had a certain element in them that they had 
never tasted before, and that they couldn't exactly put their finger on it, 
but it was good. Mind you, I served this only to my family and dear friends.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>If I feel my marriage needs a little kick, be it peace, love or spice, I 
will often work my magicks in the kitchen, and always for the higher good.</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">***</pre><br>
<tt>I first wrote the above to Rawn privately, not wanting to derail the list, 
and asked him, &quot;Would a Hermetist say I was wrong in doing this?&quot; Rawn 
responded, and prompted me to share this with the rest of you:</tt><br>
<br>
<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><pre style="margin: 0em;">From: &quot;Rawn Clark&quot; &lt;rawnclark@...&gt;

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Dear Amberlyn,</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">&gt;&gt; Would a Hermetist say I was wrong in doing this? &lt;&lt;</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">;-) Heavens no! A Hermeticist would say, &quot;Right On!!!! She's a
magician!&quot;! ;) What you have described is the essence of the
Eucharistic magic that Bardon described. The only difference is that
Bardon de-personalized it and distilled out the essential technique that
can be applied to a broader variety of circumstances and media.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I think you should relate what you told me about your magic of food to
the BardonPraxis list! It's an excellent example of how the techniques
learned in IIH can/should be personalized, made practical and given the
spark of spontaneity. [You can quote me on that! :)]</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
