<pre>Hi Peter:

It is my firm believe that the Franz Bardon Books as we know them 
were actually written word by word by Otti Votova (Bardon's 
secretary). Bardon dictated his ideas (in point form) on tape and 
she wrote the books. She and the editors of the Publisher Hermann 
Bauer put the book in wonderful German. Of course the whole Bardon 
phenomenon is a group effort. There were the &quot;invisible ones&quot; from 
the other spheres who wanted this knowledge to made known to a wider 
audience. Bardon was their willing und pliable tool to accomplish 
this task and of course Otti Votova was also a willing tool. The 
excerpts from the Golden Book of Wisdom seem inferior to the other 
texts by Bardon because it is unedited material and the inspiration 
from &quot;the invisible ones&quot; on the other side did not flow into that 
text.
At least this is the way I see it.

Best wishes:
Richard

Trismegistos)


&quot;&quot;&quot;Subject: Re: The Golden Book of Wisdom online

After reading through these three existing chapters of the Golden 
Book of Wisdom in both English and German I am struck by a number of 
things. The most notible of which would be the very deep gut feeling 
that this was not written by Franz Bardon. It has a totally 
different 
writing style, along with a different personality and tone to it. I 
don't know if it is just me, but this is something that just sticks 
with me. I might be no linguist to be able to show the differences 
between the two writing styles, however, I do feel that they are 
definetly there.

I'm just wondering if anyone has had any similar feelings about this 
passage?

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist&quot;&quot;&quot;
