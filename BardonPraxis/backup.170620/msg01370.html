Dear Antiloop

People who say something is always right, are always proved wrong (at 
least most of teh time)

I mentionned that fasting a few days was good for a person a good 
health, I agree with you it is better to temper that. People would 
reast differently. 

Strictly from a medical point of vue, fasting a few days (3 to 5) is 
unlikely to cause any harm to a person in a reasonable health. You 
eliminate toxins and fat. The body regenerates. You will need a few 
days to recover. And it is definitely right to relax and not to work.

THe 1st 2 days weakness is due mainly to the lack of sugar in the 
organism. And yes, you will sleep a lot and feel tired. 
Drinking Fruit Juice or honney is a good way to help.


&gt; By the third day I had slept 
&gt; 12 hours because I was so weak and I barely had energy to do 
&gt; anything. After being awake for only 1 or 2 hours I just wanted to 
go 
&gt; back to bed and rest more. I could not even think very clearly as I 
&gt; was indeed so weak. I longed for the fast to be over, because it 
was 
&gt; affecting my ability to function. 
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly enough, I was not hungry at all past the morning of 
the 
&gt; second day. I did find this part of the experience quite 
fascinating 
&gt; and for that alone I thought the experience was worthwhile doing. 
In 
&gt; my current present, when I am very hungry, instead of obeying my 
&gt; instinct and going to some fast food or less than healthy 
restaurant 
&gt; on the way home from work, I just smile to myself and think &quot;You 
have 
&gt; survived 3 days eating almost nothing, surely you can wait 2 more 
&gt; hours to eat, and this will help you gain more will power if you do 
&gt; so&quot;. 
&gt; 

This proves that your 3 days fasting has affected the way you relates 
to food a positive way. You feel quieter, and less &quot;convulsive&quot; when 
dealing with the food. You are less afraid of missing food and are 
more confident with the ability of your body to cope with hunger.

&gt; Part of the intent of my entering this fast was to feel lighter and 
&gt; to feel more connected to the Universe, as you nicely put... for 
&gt; spiritual reasons. I can tell you there was no such result at all. 
&gt; Instead I felt very weak and unable to take advantage of my 
&gt; feeling &quot;lighter&quot; for this purpose. I had less ability to 
concentrate 
&gt; on anything because I hungry during the first day and physically 
and 
&gt; mentally exhausted the days after.

What I feel, is that 3 days is possibly not enough for your body to 
cope with the miss. 
To give you an ideas of what is &quot;extreme fasting&quot;, in the 80's 2 
irish activists put in jail fastens for 60 days to get a political 
prisonner status. ONe of the 2 died after 63 days, the other was fed 
in hospital after 60 days and is now fine with no remaining effect. 
This is extreme fasting. A person mastering techics such as prana 
breathing could possibly go much further. I do not advice to do so.


&gt; 
&gt; The other interesting experience from this fast is that after it 
was 
&gt; all finally over and I could eat normally again, I was very aware 
&gt; that there was no way I could just sit down and have a regular 
&gt; meal... even one most of us consider healthy. I was aware my 
stomach 
&gt; could not handle the shock of processing such complex foods 
&gt; immediately nor the regular quantities of food I normally eat, and 
&gt; that I had to get back to normal progressively and slowly. 
Therefore 
&gt; my first meal consisted of a very small portion of flavourless 
&gt; organic yoghurt and a few pieces of simple bread. Had I sat down 
for 
&gt; a big mac and large fries with coke, I am sure I would have been in 
&gt; the hospital in less than 30 minutes! ;-)

FOr 3 days fasting, I am not so sure. But, well, considering big mac 
and large fries with coke is extreme eating, it is possible...;-)
I probably would go directly to the hospital with no fasting with 
such a meal.

&gt; 
&gt; I would still recommend people do a fast if they've never done one 
in 
&gt; their lives, but be careful on how drastic the fast is, and with 
that 
&gt; in mind, how long you strain your body for. If you start to feel 
VERY 
&gt; weak, then you know you can not extend this too much longer. What 
&gt; others are capable of is not necessarily a reflection of what you 
can 
&gt; do at the moment, so yes push your will to the limits, but don't 
&gt; sacrifice your health for this.
&gt; 

Really, for a person in normal heath, it is unlikely that he or she 
will sacrifice her health for a 3-5 days fast. BODY IS ABLE TO COPE 
(of course if not done too often); the best time is at season start 
(except winter).

I am not a doctor. One should take some good medical advices if any 
doubts or if any illness.

best regards, 

Pierre Mikael
