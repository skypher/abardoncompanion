<pre>Dear Joe,

&gt;&gt; It seems very easy to read too deeply into IIH exercises and over
complicate them; I think it would be a usefull practice if
individuals upon completing each step (esp. the early ones) wrote a
list of problems they had to overcome and the solutions they found.
This would allow ppl still stuck on the step to gain a wider
perspective, and maybe gain some confidence and insight. Any1 want to
comment on this idea? &lt;&lt;

This sounds like a good idea. I would gladly make space on my website
for such a thing!

&gt;&gt; 1) In the one-pointedness exercise is it recomended to stick with one
subject from session to session, or to pick a different one each time? I
found it easier to use some than others, but I wonder if just picking
subjects i'm drawn to will make later excersises more difficult? &lt;&lt;

Ultimately, you need to learn how to affix your mind upon ANY thing, no
matter how little or much it attracts you. If learning this ability is
easiest for you by at first using your affinity as an entry point, then
so be it, so long as you *also* become able to focus upon the
unappetizing.

&gt;&gt; Also in this exercise, is it satisfactory to retain a
single thought for 10 minutes if other thoughts are dimly experienced
from time to time (though you do not lose the focussed on thought). I
mean if a car goes by and makes a noise, I may not get an image of a
car or any strong reaction, but a small part of my focus will briefly
`look` in that direction if you know what i'm saying!? Is this a
digression? How perfect does the exercise at this level have to be? &lt;&lt;

Anything that redirects your focus is a &quot;digression&quot;. However, what you
describe, where a *passive part of* your overall consciousness perceives
the car's passing but does not disrupt your focus, is not a
&quot;digression&quot;. No matter how detached you are, your physical ears will
still register the car's passing and your brain will, to some degree,
respond to the stimulus. What's crucial here is that all of those
bodily functions occur in the background and that your *mind* remains
independently focused. If, on the other hand, the car does divert your
focus, then that constitutes a &quot;digression&quot;.

&gt;&gt; 2) This year i'm likely to be swamped with study. Would you consider
it acceptable to practice for an hour once/day instead of twice? Am I
likely to make progress in this manner? ... some days i'll be able to
practice more, but uni has to come first this year. &lt;&lt;

Well, you can only do what's possible and since only one hour per day is
what's possible, then that's all you can do. I think it's better to
feel good about doing what you can do, than it is to beat yourself up
for not doing what you're unable to do. ;-) In other words, yes, as
much time as you *can* devote is enough!

Your rate of progress *might* not be as swift but you *will* still make
progress. :) Besides, there's no hurry . . . you have the whole of
infinite time itself.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
