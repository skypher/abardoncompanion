<pre>Justin,

It is my opinion that the three meditative exercises found within 
step one are essentially the same thing, with only qualitiative as 
opposed quantitative differences. Within the observation of though, 
vacancy of mind can be found in the empty spaces that exist between 
one thought and the next. Within one pointedness, the vacancy of mind 
exists behind the one pointedness and in vacancy of mind, the one 
pointedness exists behind the vacancy, penetrating into the subject 
that was previously held within the sights of one pointedness before 
slipping into the vacancy.

In some respects, one could say that observation of thoughts exists 
within the water region of the mental body, one pointedness within 
the air region, and vacancy of mind being found within the fire 
region of the mental body.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist

&gt; Ave,

&gt; Have past experience, but am working on Step 1 on IIH, as have just 
of late
&gt; fortunately stumbled upon Bardon's work. So, when 
exercising &quot;thought
&gt; control&quot; meditations in the past, there have been many methods, but 
the one
&gt; that is the most basic yet most rewarding is the focus on the 
breath.
&gt; Watching it enter and leave, watching the movement of the abdomen 
pulling
&gt; and pushing, rising and falling. The duality of it all, can easily 
hold
&gt; unwavering attention for quite some time. In IIH's Step 1, this 
method would
&gt; probably fall under the &quot;single-thought&quot; version of the meditation. 
However,
&gt; after about ten minutes of focusing on the breath, it's as if it 
becomes
&gt; automatic without losing the intense focus. Like that's where the 
mind is
&gt; at, but it's not thinking about it, it's just happening. This, 
state of the
&gt; meditation, seems like it would fit in the &quot;vacancy of mind&quot; 
version of Step
&gt; 1's meditation. Though, it seems like this approach is different 
than that
&gt; illustatrated by Bardon, for he says that in this last step of the
&gt; meditation, all thoughts should be energetically dismissed. In the 
method
&gt; illustrated above though, there is not a chance for thoughts to come
&gt; through, because the focus is on the breath, that is the sole 
thought. Then,
&gt; from the &quot;1&quot; thought, it transmutes to the &quot;0&quot; thought, just out of
&gt; calibrating and aligning, if you will, the planes of self. Perhaps, 
this is
&gt; exactly what is meant by the Step 1 meditation, and this was all 
just
&gt; further description for it. In any case, this may be of some help 
to others.
&gt; 
&gt; PaxAmoreLvx,
&gt; Justin
&gt; AV

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round,
&gt; I really love to watch them roll&quot;
