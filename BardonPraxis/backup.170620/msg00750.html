<pre> Just a thought (well more then that actually). In cross of equated 
force we can see that each element has two basic attributes which are 
polar (either hot or cold, either dry or wet). Thanks to this logical 
disposition the cross is equal. Now, with those elements being the 
same elements to which we assign our negative/positive mirror items, 
doesn't it make sense that the cross still applies, only with changed 
names of attributes (but not meanings behind those names). So the 
human concepts of hot/cold, dry/wet could be replaced with their 
eqivalent which are more comfortable to use with our psyche. But 
there is still a task of finding the right words, which will be 
compatible with true meanings of each attribute. And after that, 
assigning items to elements should be much more easier; it doesn't 
mean you won't need to meditate on each item but you should have good 
guiding lights.
Anyway, so far I succeeded partially... by replacing hot/cold with 
active/passive. For hot means existance of temperature, which also 
means movement of particles, activity. Now when you look at one 
negative item you will notice that your faliure is either in 
something you done or something you didn't do, but should have. I 
trust you will know in which case to assign active/passive.
As for second attribute its a bit of headache. If I know the true 
meaning behind wet/dry it would be much easier. The first thing I 
associated it with was moving/motionless. This might sound a bit 
controversial because that would mean fire has 'motionless' 
and 'active' attached to it, while water would be 'moving' 
and 'passive'. But I think the two can work together, we just need to 
think of those terms in right way. Fire is usually associated with 
movement, but I think its opinion caused by physical manifestation of 
fire, which wouldn't spread and move at all if it wasn't for water, 
air, and earth. What I think fire trully is as *element* is something 
active, but still, the fire will show its moving nature only when 
interacting with other elements(so fire is only potential). On the 
other hand, water is passive, and it takes into itself rather then 
burning out, but for the sake of polarity, lets say it also has 
attribute of 'moving'. Figuring out how to assign moving/still 
attribute to soul mirror item is a bit harder, but lets say you run 
from something that you should have faced instead. You didn't do 
anything to change the thing that bothers you, so assign the 
word 'passive'. But what about second attribute? You *run* from 
facing the trouble, going somewhere else, which means you 
were 'moving'. Passivity and tendency to move brings us to wather 
element. In general, many cowardly actions can be assigned to water 
element, unless greed or such was goal for acting cowardly. 
Anyway, the air element which stands between fire and water is 
moving/active. On the other hand earth turns out to be 
motionless/passive. How can this earth element, wonderful display of 
all elements working together be both still and passive? Well I think 
that definition might be true, if we take into account that 
earth/physical reality is in perfect balance, something which comes 
from nowhere and goes nowhere. 
I will stop here, all I wrote is just theory, especially the part 
about second attribute, but I think it so far worked good for me, it 
helped me make some sense in assigning soul mirror items to elements.
