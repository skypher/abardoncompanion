<pre>Dear JCH,

&gt;&gt; Well, now I'm finding myself interested much more in exploring the
infinite universe and in aligning myself with Divine Providence than in
escaping from suffering or dissolving in Nirvana. Maybe it is only my
misunderstanding of the aims of buddhism or yoga, &lt;&lt;

Superficial understanding is much the same thing as misunderstanding and
it sounds to me that you, like many others on this list, have only a
very superficial understanding of Buddhism and yoga and therefore make a
lot of erroneous assumptions about them. For example, Buddha did not
teach escapism and yoga is not *just* about manipulation of kundalini,
yet these assumptions seem to color most of the thoughts expressed here
lately about Buddhism and yoga.

&gt;&gt; Now to my problem. Last year I have found myself very tightened and
full of many fears, which have often been associated with the conflict
between how I want to look like before people and how I feel or want to
act. I just cannot put aside the habit of controlling myself even if I
wish to let it flow. Therefore I often feel big presure, even pain on my
solar plexus and I find it quite negative. I think that this can be the
result of my working with energy which I realy love. But sometimes it is
too strong and I find myself unable to handle such amount of energy. Of
course it is possible to go out and do some physical work as running,
but I think tehre could be some exercise that can help to use this
energy in more efficient way. I'm trying to open nadis and chakras, but
I feel it is often too violent and I don't want to harm myself. If you
could share your experiences, I would be very grateful. &lt;&lt;

Forcing the &quot;nadis and chakras&quot; open, especially without character
transformation, is indeed quite dangerous and is *not* part of
*Bardon's* system. If you sincerely wish to follow Bardon's system and
truly reap the results that Bardon described then I recommend that you
set aside your work with the &quot;nadis and chakras&quot;.

What you have described above is not a solar *opening* but rather, a
closing and blockage. This reaction is natural when one tries to force
open a chakra without first having undertaken the necessary character
transformation and evolution and thus reached the level of maturity
corresponding to the chakra in question. The remedy for this blockage
is to undertake the character transformation work outlined in Steps One
through Three of IIH.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
