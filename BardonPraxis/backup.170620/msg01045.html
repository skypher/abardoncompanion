<pre>Dear Rawn,

&gt;&gt;&gt;Good! :) It's *essential* that you continue your IIH progress if 
you wish to progress with KTQ.&lt;&lt;&lt;

This would relate back to my previous statement as to how far I can 
go with the work in Kabbalah with the stage that I am at. I ment, if 
I left my practicing of the steps of IIH and started working almost 
exclusivly upon the work of KTQ it is fairly obvious that I could 
only go so far. As such, I guess I'm going to have to be balancing my 
work between IIH and KTQ.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What followed was beautifully written! Would you agree to my 
including it (credited to you, of course) in my next website update 
of the Correspondence section? As you say, others will benefit from 
what you've written.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Sure thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Just like you mention further on about the progression of steps to
learning the direct perception of essential meaning, the same
incremental process, starting from the densest layer and moving 
upwards to the more and more ephemeral, is applied. You start with 
the VE which is a dense Elemental composite. Then you move up the 
ladder of density to the Elements and learn to master them. The 
experience with the Elements leads you to the perception of the 
Fluids and their mastery. When you manipulate the Fluids, the 
Elements follow in accordance, so this is a &quot;higher&quot; form of magic. 
Without the Elemental work as a prerequisite, it would be VERY 
difficult to master the Fluids.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Then following that logic, then it would be rather difficult to 
master the letters with out mastering the fluids first. But from my 
own minimal experience with the letters, it would seem to the 
contrary. I guess, like most things there is the possibility of 
working from the bottom up, and working from the top down to some 
extent. Yet to work from the top down there is a need to have started 
and progressed well upon the path that moves from the bottom up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;This is the boundary between *perception* and *interpretation*.
Interpretation by the lower aspects of mind kicks in almost instantly.
This is the part of mind that first *recognizes* the perception, which
is an act that pulls the perception out of its infinite setting and 
down into the realm of the finite. Otherwise, the brain would have no 
way of processing it. As you get more and more comfortable with the 
direct perception, you will more easily straddle the fence between 
realms, so to speak, and even learn to place your awareness in that 
microsecond between infinite perception and the beginning of finite 
interpretation. Nonetheless, you must always return to the lower 
levels of awareness so it's wise to learn the Art of integrating the 
higher perceptions into those layers.&lt;&lt;&lt;

When I first experienced the direct perception of essential meaning, 
as I described previously, it was like I was seeing &quot;infinity within 
a blade of grass, and eternity in every hour&quot; to put it poetically. 
Yet once I returned to normal waking consciousness, it all faded away 
into something that I could only half remember. In subsequent 
attempts to achieve the direct perception of essential meaning I had 
problems attaining such a state of mind, though when I did it was 
only for fleeting moments through whcih I have eventually been 
starting to remember more and more of the perceptions of essential 
meaning.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, the Lights are different than the Elements and Fluids. They 
stand in relation to the Fluids in the same way that the Fluids do to 
the Elements. An accumulation and condensation of the Lights that
correspond to brain and heart, within those organs will not cause a 
disruption of their electrical functions in the way that a similar 
accumulation of an Element or Fluid could. The Lights interact with 
the universal materia in a somewhat different manner than do the 
Elements and Fluids.&lt;&lt;&lt;

That makes sense. Then I take it that the working with the Lights is 
something that can be used to help heal the internal organs in a 
fashion that is potentially safer than trying to do so with the 
Elements? Such a work exists within certian Chinese traditions of 
Qigong that is known as the Wu Xing, or the five elements, which are 
associated with five of the major internal organs: heart, lungs, 
stomach, spleen and liver which are associated with five colours, 
five sounds, five directions and five planets. In a certian number of 
respects it bears a rather strong resemblence within Bardon's 
Kabbalah. Yet another expression of universal principles, I guess.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The Water pole correspondences aside, there is a difference in the
quality of an accumulation of the various Lights. For example the 'C' 
(tzaddi) is very fiery with its vermillion red and the 'Ch' (Cheth) 
with its sparkling silvery violet, is very invigorating and alive, in 
comparison with the expansive 'A' (aleph) with its sky blue. But the 
quantity of stress (i.e., the dynamic force) that each of these 
different flavors of accumulated Light bring to the body is the 
same.&lt;&lt;&lt;

I guess this would be why Bardon calls the Fire Pole an exercise in 
the mysticism of Letters. Which in and of itself doesn't make too 
much sense, but in regards to the Golden Book of Wisdom in which 
Bardon states that magic is the study of quanity while mysticism 
refers to quality. Hence with this work I seem to be better 
understanding of the qualities of the Letters while I work with them, 
in addition to starting to spontaniously see how these qualities 
manifest throughout existence upon the mental, astral and material 
planes of existence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As I stated in my KTQ Commentary, there are limits to what I'm 
willing to discuss regarding KTQ, in public. Some of your questions 
have already taken me right up to the boarder of my limits and I've 
debated whether to answer you here on the BardonPraxis, or to answer 
you in private instead. So don't be surprised if I end up answering 
some of your future questions here, in public, and some in private, 
through direct correspondence. :)&lt;&lt;&lt;

Having started to work through the Fire pole, I completely understand 
what you are talking about. And I also completely understand why you 
say that it is rather rare that a person who has completed step five 
within IIH has very little need for guidence from external sources 
due to their connection with their greater guardian genious. However, 
since I'm just starting the work of the passive communication with 
the great guardian genious and am working towards deeping my more 
intimate connection with it as well, I'm probably still going to be 
asking as many questions as I can in the meantime. Though most of the 
questions will be with regards to matters other than Kabbalah. I'll 
be putting forth experiences and theories that I need confirmation 
upon as to their credibility, though I'm pretty sure at one point or 
another I'm going to have to start trusting my gut on such matters.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
