<pre>I don't think the intention behind the silence pillar is to avoid
all discussion.
After all, the training is in print, it's not exactly hidden from the
world.

Hermeticism has existed as an 'academic' discipline since the study of
Ancient Egyptian history and beyond. There are degree disciplines in 
Europe that study the Hermetic current and its influence within society.
There are ways to introduce it into conversation without any raised
eyebrows ;-)

Beyond that, I reckon the 'Silence' aspect has a lot to do with your own

'practice', especially the further you progress, and avoiding the
feeling that
you're somehow better than others. Further on, its about showing you're
able to be responsible with such knowledge. And obviously, as Rawn 
mentioned elsewhere, ensuring your pursuit of Bardon isn't for the
purpose of a 'talking point', and is for the right reasons.

One can also think of the silence as an inner quality, with very little
to do with the act of 'talking', beyond the obvious points made.
So much of Bardon relies upon reaching, sustaining and deepening
the Emptiness of Mind. Is this not silence?


Just a few thoughts.

Richard

&gt;From where I sit the Step 1 work with soul mirrors is outstanding. In
fact 
the whole of Step 1 is wonderful. I began by thinking I couldn't wait to

accumulate a few elements, meet a sylph or two, and do some cool mental
travelling 
- but this is better than any of that. It is life-changing. It is
wonderful. 
As I go through it I keep thinking, I wish I could tell other people
how to 
do this. I know we have to keep silent but it seems to me that the
technique 
is a very valid alternative to all the me-me-meness, the endless
therapy 
schools, the moral vapidity that people are subjected to. Simply
exercise, have a 
cold shower, observe your thoughts, and write down your worst and best 
characteristics. It's... like magic! It offers perspective, I feel like
I'm 
breathing for the first time in a long time to have everything just
where I can see 
it. It's calisthenic, you do it, you put effort in and out pops reward.

One of my (Lesser) negative traits is my blabbering mouth. I want to
tell 
everyone what is happening but I don't necessarily think it's such a
good idea. 
All I'm saying is, I wish everyone could do this. I feel kind of
separated 
from other people. Most of the people I know I would classify as 'good'
people, 
which I would define as people trying to work on themselves. I think
these 
techniques are like a moral boot camp, something that would clear up
alot of 
issues for alot of people I know. But I also don't feel I can honestly
tell 
anyone about them. I know there is a way forward that any fool can take
who is 
dissatisfied with themselves, you don't need to pay fees and you will
make 
progress. But I have to keep it a secret! It's hard.... that's all!

Sorry to whine, best wishes to all on the list, Jason
