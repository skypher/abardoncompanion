<pre>Tim...thanks for your response, but maybe I should clarify....I'm 
interested in knowing how I should deal with the presuppositions that 
have taken up residence in me because of my upbringing (I am a 
Baptist minister's son) and the modifications of these &quot;assumptions&quot; 
that I have accepted along the way. What is taboo in some religious 
disciplines is standard fare in others. 

I have difficulty believing that &quot;what is true for me is true.&quot; If I 
am to ascertain &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;positive&quot; traits in soul mirror work, 
how do I deal with these presuppositions?

Thanks.....John

&gt; Dear RM and all
&gt; 
&gt; I like the question you posed, and it's one I considered myself in 
&gt; years gone by before begining to working through IIH in earnest. 
&gt; Though I have only been a Bardon practicioner for five months I 
feel 
&gt; I have had the issue answered for me.
&gt; 
&gt; During the five years since I began to call myself a magician I 
went 
&gt; headlong and fearlessly (stupidly?)into all manner of practices 
&gt; stopping short of direct evocation of 'demonic' entities - stuff 
that 
&gt; would fall under the 'masculine' heading I guess. At times I have 
&gt; felt that my sanity/life was on the line (especially whilst going 
&gt; through some Enochian aethyrs, for example), but nevertheless I 
would 
&gt; do it all again considering the results I obtained. 
&gt; 
&gt; However, ever since reading Bardon, everything I accomplished 
seemed 
&gt; a little like cheating, since I was doing things on the back of 
&gt; formulas (like the Middle Pillar formula, Lightning Flash, powerful 
&gt; mantras, theurgy and so forth). These, in my opinion raise the self 
&gt; to the necessary level for performing a task, but temporarily. And 
I 
&gt; felt after operations that I had only got a 'slice' or taster of 
what 
&gt; was there to experience.
&gt; 
&gt; What I like about Bardon's method is that he begins with IIH - a 
&gt; carefully set out program that if practiced in order and to the 
&gt; letter enables the practicioner to accomplish magic by producing 
&gt; everything needed from 'within' themselves at will any time any 
&gt; place, and in a more comprehensive way than anything else I have 
ever 
&gt; tried so far.
&gt; Personally, I find the practices from the start - 'controling' 
&gt; thoughts, accumulation and balancing elements etc. to be quite 
active 
&gt; or 'masculine' in their nature - and quite a buzz too.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I still enjoy doing the 'bang-crash-wallop' stuff I have 
&gt; always done too, and personally have no problem mixing the two. I 
&gt; guess in conclusion, I must agree that the former does feel more 
&gt; masculine to me too. But in reality it is only such at face value - 
&gt; Bardon is equally 'active', but without the ceremony, at least to 
&gt; begin with.
&gt; 
&gt; So I hope I had added my pennies-worth in at least a fairly 
coherent 
&gt; (if general) way - and hope others will add to or challenge this 
&gt; perspective.
&gt; 
&gt; T.

&gt; &gt; Good afternoon dear colleagues.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For some time I have been thinking about the Feminine / Masculine 
&gt; &gt; axis of polarity and about Balance. I have hesitated to bring 
this 
&gt; up 
&gt; &gt; for fear of causing offense where none is intended. Nevertheless 
a 
&gt; &gt; question not asked is wisdom forgone. So . . .
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that Hermetics as described in IIH and as 
discussed 
&gt; in 
&gt; &gt; this list is a little skewed towards the Feminine pole. Much of 
the 
&gt; &gt; emphasis is on meditation, passive observation of inner states, 
and 
&gt; &gt; learning &quot;to be&quot; in a higher sense of the concept. Although 
Bardon 
&gt; &gt; describes the actual doing of magick it doesn't seem to get as 
much 
&gt; &gt; emphasis as the more receptive exercises. Certainly on this list 
I 
&gt; &gt; don't read much about summoning power, casting spells, and making 
&gt; &gt; things happen out in the world - in other words, I don't hear 
much 
&gt; &gt; about the Masculine aspects of Hermetics.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is the focus of our discussions out of balance or (perhaps) is 
the 
&gt; &gt; focus deliberately skewed towards the Feminine to compensate for 
a 
&gt; &gt; culture that favors the Masculine?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sincerely, /RM/
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; P.S. Please note that I am talking about Feminine / Masculine in 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; esoteric sense - I'm not referring to specific traits of female / 
&gt; &gt; male members of the human species.
