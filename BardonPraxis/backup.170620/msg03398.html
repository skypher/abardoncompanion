Yes it was helpful. I remember in the Questions and Answers Bardon 
says that, I think, some type of thoughts don't originate from our 
own minds but are picked out of the Ether.

I guess I should just get into a day dreaming mindset and just 
observe and remember it.

&gt; Another possiblity is that we ASSUME our understanding 
of 'thought' and of 
&gt; 'ourselves' is significant enough to ascertain OURSELVES and our 
awareness 
&gt; accurately and correctly. Since that 'understanding' is based upon 
a 
&gt; possible set of inherent ignorances (a limited sphere of 
understanding 
&gt; acting from a place of believing it understands itself and does 
not see the 
&gt; fence surrounding and limiting its awareness), it believes it can 
trust its 
&gt; own judgement and grasp something that only EXPERIENCE can 
illuminate. Its a 
&gt; trick of the rational mind to reduce anything to ridiculousness if 
it cannot 
&gt; be grasped by that finite persceptive quality.
&gt; 
&gt; It has been my experience that there is much more to my mind and 
to &quot;my&quot; 
&gt; thought (if it is &quot;mine&quot;.. ??) than my personality and 
consciousness grasps. 
&gt; Most growth is only determined as such when looking backwards upon 
the time 
&gt; spent. Most growth happens when one is not paying attention. Else, 
one may 
&gt; impede ones own growth. Consider learning to walk as a child.. did 
we KNOW 
&gt; and understand or simply &quot;do until done,..look back and 
comprehend..&quot;? We 
&gt; TRUSTED in others. Faith.
&gt; 
&gt; My suggestion, temporarily suspend your own opinion concerning 
such 
&gt; things.. rational grasping and understanding is overrated 
sometimes as the 
&gt; be and end all of awareness. Its only your rational mind. Not much 
in IHH is 
&gt; typically &quot;Rational&quot;.. So, its a good place to begin suspending 
your 
&gt; opinion. It may not serve u here to hold to your opinion, consider 
it a 
&gt; &quot;guardian&quot; of sorts. Dont let it imprison you behind the doorway 
that it 
&gt; guards. You can invite it back later on if u desire to. It is 
possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Then, TRUST and act in the belief that others who have bumped into 
this same 
&gt; 'wall', passed it the same way. And u will as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Your INTENTION is not necessarily always associated with your 
AWARENESS of 
&gt; that INTENTION. Your INTENTION may be outside of your 
personalities 
&gt; self-awareness. So, it would be outside the toolset (if u will) of 
that 
&gt; persceptive 'vehicle'. Dont trust your opinion, just let it serve 
u, try not 
&gt; to serve it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; I sincerely hope that helps some.
&gt; Its simply my 'opinion'. ;)

&gt; &gt;I don't see how a thought or train of thought can originate by
&gt; &gt;itself without your own intention and involvement in the thought,
