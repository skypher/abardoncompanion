<pre>Hi,

I would have to agree with most of what you're saying. But I feel 
that you are addressing a quite different issue than the one I was 
addressing. I brought up the example of discomfort at meals with my 
family when I was younger not to talk about the petty tyrants in my 
life, but rather to illustrate my point that my past affects my 
present in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Knowing that is only one 
part of changing it.

So in particular, your statement:
&gt; Try not identifying with them as you. They are feelings. They are 
not you. 

That may be true, but the feelings stem from beliefs that I hold, for 
better or for worse, as a result of certain past experiences, which I 
must needs deal with because they bring about certain behaviors or 
mental habits that prevent me from progressing. So in a sense you're 
right, but I guess I have to take a deep look at all of why I resist 
myself so much. Like digging up the roots of a tree, I suppose.

Thanks for your comments though. Many times in my life I have found 
myself in a difficult situation with people whom I don't respect who 
are nevertheless in positions of arbitrary power over me, or 
situations in which I've given power away and feel helpless. Those 
are always difficult to get through, but I totally agree, the most 
difficult situations are the ones with the most opportunity for 
growth and self-awareness.

Doesn't make it easy or simple though. :)


Thanks,
David

&gt; Greetings.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to suggest a modification of attitude that may help. 
Tyrants 
&gt; are blessings waiting to be received.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Personally I believe that the most potentially profitable persons 
in our 
&gt; life OR situations in our life are where we must internally modify 
ourselves 
&gt; to respond to a tyrant or tyrannical situation.
&gt; 
&gt; If I *know* why I am doing something (why I am submitting my time 
or energy 
&gt; or opinions, etc. (ie What is my INTENT.) to some tyrant or 
tyrannical 
&gt; situation, then I may get bruised, broken, insulted, etc. 
(wonderful for the 
&gt; soul mirror BTW..). Bruises heal... breaks mend, insults are more 
about me 
&gt; than the tyrant, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; ex. Staying in a job where you are unhappy for as long as you need 
to get 
&gt; what you need on your resume to move on or mature where it does not 
effect 
&gt; you anymore and you realise you may find JOY (not necessarily 
happiness - 
&gt; unsure about definition) anywhere you desire to, even there.
&gt; 
&gt; In the end, *my intent* is made manifest and I depart knowing I was 
master 
&gt; of my choices at all times, even **when I believed** that the 
**tyrant 
&gt; believed** that they controlled. If I could put aside my ego and 
false self 
&gt; importance long enough to recall *my intent* for being there, then 
once 
&gt; again, I didnt need a *reflection of their belief to convince me* 
of my own 
&gt; intent or strength or &quot;reason d'etre&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I would submit to you that &quot;Personalities&quot; must have reflections to 
feel 
&gt; satisfied that they have accomplished something (ie - it must be 
seen and 
&gt; aknowledged by others mainly to be accepted as a fact in the 
personalities 
&gt; expereince). My &quot;whole self&quot; perhaps does not ( I dont believe it 
does... 
&gt; consider One Pointedness experiences) and the subtle is supposed to 
rule the 
&gt; gross.
&gt; 
&gt; Its not about grasping power from something as much as it is about 
moving 
&gt; out of the way so that power may manifest through you without 
corruption.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It seems that I need to tackle these feelings, otherwise I won't be
&gt; &gt;able to progress.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;David
&gt; 
&gt; Try not identifying with them as you. They are feelings. They are 
not you. 
&gt; (IIH step 1A)
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps your understanding (childlike level w/o words emotionally 
that 
&gt; influences us all hidden and without a name - metaphorically 
speaking) could 
&gt; profit from a understanding that you choose no matter what and that 
you 
&gt; cannot escape the consequence of your choices... (once this is an 
accepted 
&gt; fact in the person (i think) there is little room for obvious 
resentment) -&gt; 
&gt; thus the rebelliousness feelings b/c your personlity emotively does 
not 
&gt; question that someone else is taking power over you and reacts 
without your 
&gt; conscious awareness that it is reacting in incomplete understanding.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps Power is always granted, never taken. Power over self, 
inner choices 
&gt; and attitudes, not physical conditions is the area I speak of.
&gt; 
&gt; ONce again, I ramble and my personality is witness. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; With respect ,
&gt; 
&gt; :T:
