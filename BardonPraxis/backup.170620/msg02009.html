&gt; Two things here. Number one, when we recognize a problem or a 
habit
&gt; that no longer serves us, it's time to *change that habit* but 
using our
&gt; failing as an excuse for continuing on in the same vein is not 
allowed.
&gt; ;-)

Yep, that's exactly what I have been doing, it's like circular 
logic: &quot;This is the way I am therefore this is the way I am.&quot; I 
needed someone to hold a mirror up to that though, thank you. I need 
to reflect on that point and similar things before I implement a 
plan of action, me thinks.

&gt; Number two is that I suggest you don't think of your &quot;spiritual 
work&quot; as
&gt; a &quot;major thing&quot;. If you put it in that category then you've 
immediately
&gt; set yourself up for problems. Instead, I suggest you think of it 
as a
&gt; necessity like feeding yourself or sleeping.

Hmmm, that's a new perspective for me. I really hope that I will be 
able to see it as a necessity, but to start with I believe that will 
be difficult, as all the things I recognize as true necessities at 
the moment relate to the physical world and the physical body. Being 
able to make that switch to perceive 'mental' things as a necessity 
will be a big achievement in itself.



&gt; I find it interesting when some one, with one breath, talks about 
the
&gt; books they're reading -- which takes considerable time -- and in 
the
&gt; next breath mentions that they don't have the time for their 
exercises .
&gt; . . Which is more important?

You got me on that one. It is true, although I have only had time to 
read since I broke up for the Christmas holiday and I think I feared 
to use the time to go back to the exercises because I knew that once 
I started studying/working again, it would be difficult to find the 
time to carry on. I suppose if you believe you are going to fail, 
it's easy to just never try and to save face. Again, this is 
something else I need to examine and work through, because I have 
not had that attitude towards other challenges in my life.


&gt; Have you tried either of these options? Have you tried changing 
it, or
&gt; even tried accepting it?

I've been thinking about this question since you posted your 
message, Rawn and I honestly cannot answer it fully! Have I tried 
changing it? Perhaps half-heartedly. Have I tried accepting it? I 
don't want to accept it, it would feel wrong I suppose.


&gt; Yes, I would. However, it won't exactly be from scratch since 
you've a
&gt; pretty good idea what's involved and you know the process, etc. 
The
&gt; second time around, Step One is much easier. :)

Thank you for the support, Rawn... and the patience! Does it not 
frustrate you to see people beginning with IIH, progressing a 
little, then letting it slide and having to start again?

Oh! Let me take this opportunity to wish the group a belated 'happy 
birthday!'

Martin
