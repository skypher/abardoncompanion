<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><tt>On Satan ...<br>
...The concept also presents a subtle schism to the psyche of the believer. 
For example, how can an all-powerful and perfect god be in contention 
with an equally powerful imperfect devil? This essential dualism simply 
doesn't fit with a *mono* theism and this confuses the psyche at an 
unconscious level, again increasing both the sense of self-powerlessness 
and dependence upon the religious hierarchy.&lt;
</tt></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;"><br>Rawn,</pre><br>
<tt>I have never experienced the concept/idea/teaching that &quot;Satan&quot; and &quot;G-d&quot; 
are of equivalent power or influence. I do not believe it is taught in any 
Catholic or Protestant (or otherwise) Christian church. Nor, to my knowledge 
and experience, has this particuler doctrine or dogma ever been part of the 
teachings of Christianity, Judaism, etc.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>It is how children often understand it PERHAPS b/c their parental /social 
models seem to give it so much equal footing and speak of it at the same 
time. It is a developed and too often unchallenged assumption developed 
over time into an unseen habit. An unseen &quot;already-listening&quot; w/o 
investigation into its reliability simply b/c it is assumed by that time to 
be correctly understood... and conveniently, I may add.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Much like how we mould ourselves through our own unconscious use of our own 
vocabulary and speech habits. Consciously: IIH cocerning &quot;Affirmations&quot;.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>THe &quot;schism&quot; mentioned above MAY be the child of or the fruit of an 
misunderstood and uninformed understanding of the relationship described 
Biblically. SATAN (As I understand the term) is the &quot;Adversary&quot;, coucilled 
with G-d in the Bibilical story of JOB and Was present in the proverbial 
&quot;Garden of Eden&quot; as a &quot;tester&quot; NOT as an equal power or entity to G-d. 
Again, G-d WALKED (was present) with them in the Garden.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>NON - BIBLICALLY:<br>
As I also understand a Jewish parable concerning Satan's relationhip to the 
'King&quot; (G-d).. More likened to a zealot servant, gone too much over the edge 
of &quot;his role&quot; to tempt (revealing his own limitations?)... To test the metal 
of and to reveal to the temptee his/her character under said circumstance 
(as well to the King)... b/c the King wanted His child to inherit His 
Kingdom and the King needed to see what the child was truely made of, so to 
speak.</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Likened to an angelic Soul Mirror in action, perhaps? ;)</pre><br>
<tt>Too often, our accepted understanding of Christianity and of Satan, etc. can 
be ferreted back to our own lack of dispassionate investigation... or the 
old MOSES movies..? LOL ;) and propegated to the waiting soil to spring 
again.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>A VERY human and across the board, Christian, Jew, Occultist, HUMAN, etc. 
habit.</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Thank you and with respect,
:T:</pre><br>
