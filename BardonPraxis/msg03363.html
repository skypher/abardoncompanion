<tt>I hate to disappoint, but I can't say you're stupid :-) Everything you said 
sounds fairly normal to me, having worked with many people who have 
addiction problems and having had my own struggles with addiction.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>You are going to hear thousands of ways to deal with addiction. All of the 
differing schools will tell you why theirs is the only way and they are all 
wrong, but only because everyone needs slightly different cues to overcome 
addiction. I'll give you some of the ideas I've heard from others with food 
addictions and that I've used as a personal trainer to help clients 
overcomes food urges.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>1. Once a week, for one part of the day (beginning, middle, end... I find 
that the end works best), plan on overindulging and really enjoy it. Savor 
the food. Have fun. Food isn't evil, just our attitudes toward it and our 
habits involving it.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>2. Except for that one day per week eat very well. Tolerate absolutely no 
food in your house that does not help you to achieve your goals whether the 
goals are about discipline, body weight, muscle gain, cosmetics, or 
life-style.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>3. Stay on top of your thinking. Stop thoughts like &quot;I will not eat that&quot; 
or &quot;I shouldn't&quot;, instead concentrate on what you SHOULD do, even better 
what you WILL do, NOW. So, instead of &quot;I shouldn't eat that deep-fried lard 
with tartar sauce and gravy&quot; you might think &quot;I'm eating this chicken with 
maranara sauce and steamed veggies&quot;. Keep it positive.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>4. Exercise. Regular cardiovascular exercise reduces overall levels of 
hunger. If you increase your muscle mass you increase your metabolism. 
Find exercise that you enjoy: martial arts, hiking, walking, swimming, 
weight lifting, cardio classes, yoga, pilates. Walking and swimming are 
wonderful choices (and cheap), but should be done briskly. Remember this: 
move more eat less.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Please remember this is just one way to deal with it. In general expect 
that you will have a couple of struggles. Just stay on it.</tt><br>
<br>

feel for which ones ring true to you.</tt><br>

<pre style="margin: 0em;">Hi, what is the preffered method to deal with
addictions? I have become addicted to food, and use
it for emotional support when challenges arise. This
has become a big problem, but it's going to help a lot
if folks start laughing at how ridiculous it is. My
main question: Does it help not to think about the
problem at all, or to make plans to derail it? Now
the thoughtform is big and omnious. I will use food
to avoid emotional confrontation, so any thought about
being afraid of a certain situation is a link to the
fear of food. See, Many things in my personal
inventory have gotten linked up like this, that is why
I feel trapped in a web. If anyone has experience
here is the best approach to
1. deal with one element at a time?
2. use auto suggestion to come to terms with the root
cause of the guilt. i.e. trouble homelife, or fear of
becoming a productive member of society, etc.?
3. emotionally finding a nurturing source to replace
the food comfort?
4. join a support group, or seek professional help ;-)
?
5. face it head on by using meal planning etc.
6. fasting periodically</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">So far, numbers 5. and 6. seem to work, but when I'm
under pressure a slight distraction can cause an
explosion which leads to a long period of indulgence.
And it seems as though controlling or repressing it
actually makes it stronger (even if I don't happen to
be eating at the time) For example: before this was an
issue I decided to fast for a weak for the purpose of
beginning IIH. As I went with less food, and
experience spiritual food, I felt a guilty attraction
to going back to the old way. It always started out
as a sort of morbidness. For example, a few years ago
I read something that some frater wrote about how his
biggest challenge was overcoming simple sugur. I
thought &quot;gee that could very well be me.&quot; Then after
I ate alot of food once, I can't remember why, I
thought to myself, &quot;This could become an addiction.&quot;
The thought was very quiet and subtle, and I didn't
really take it seriously. Next, after the problem
was afoot, I thought , &quot;wow, if this continues it
could really jeopordize my education&quot; I knew the
thought was crazy at the time, and I negated it, but
there was a subconscious alliance, and my thoughts
became polarized to manifest this tunnel reality. Is
there a rational reason (for example, learning how to
be compassionate towards people with challenges) why I
would do this, or should it be considered a stupid
irrationality and not given any more importance? The
more I think about the problem, the stronger it
becomes, but I am not sure if there is some sort of
hidden lesson or karma in my past that I can profit
from now that I am motivated to resolve this. I
almost considered deleting this, but is has gone on so
long, I at least need someone to tell me I'm stupid.
(in a good-natured way )</pre><br>

Dustin</pre><br>
