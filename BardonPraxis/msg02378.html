<pre>Richard,

you can cure MS with Cobra venom, it seems to stimulate the immune system as
does Bee venom.
I wrote the following few pararaphs for a friend some months ago.

Zach

&gt;From a documentary on TV lately-Some interesting alternative remedies for
Polio, multiple sclerosis and other ailments.

Bill Haast, of Florida, USA developed a remedy for Polio using Cobra venom
back in the 1950's. The progaram was stopped because the corporations were
working on a Vaccine and didn't want any competition. Bill says he can cure
anyone who has Polio, even though there are 3,500 people in the world today
who still have the disease. His remedy can be obtained in Germany but not
America (don't know about elsewhere). His venom cures are also good for
other problems like arthritus. Follow the links at
<a  href="http://www.cobras.org/article.htm">http://www.cobras.org/article.htm</a> for more info.

Every week Bill injects himself with venom from 32 varieties of snakes. He
has built up an immunity to snake venom. Although nearly ninety, he has not
had a cold or flu since 1948.

In America and other parts of the world there is a growing movement in the
use of bee venom for curing multiple sclerosis. Sufferers are usually
offered an expensive course of drugs that have no gurantee of working, and
which also give unpleasant side effects. In the Bee sting clinics people
receive 24 bee stings once a week, and this seems to stimulate the system to
the extent that symptoms are releived for a period of time.

Subject: [BardonPraxis] Application of Hermetic skills (Healing)


&gt; Hi everyone
&gt;
&gt; RE: Application of Hermetic skills to healing
&gt;
&gt; Got a question that relates more to the application
&gt; of the IIH training once one reaches PME work.
&gt; Somewhat well beyond my own level of development, I wondered
&gt; if any forum members would be able to add some insight
&gt; to the questions I have further below.
&gt;
&gt; Medicine and healing is an area that has interested me
&gt; for many years, and much to the protests of one of my
&gt; sisters and friends, I chose to work professionally in
&gt; a very different field. However, I have maintained a basic
&gt; reading curriculum across the orthodox medical field
&gt; and a number of the alternative fields (herbalism - chinese
&gt; &amp; western, acupuncture, homeopathy &amp; oesteopathy).
&gt;
&gt; For the past several years I've looked into treatments for
&gt; progressive Multiple Sclerosis, the auto-immune disease
&gt; where the body attacks the myelin sheath on the nerves.
&gt; In orthodox medicine this is a terminal and incurable form
&gt; of the disease. No alternative treatment I'm aware of can
&gt; help either, only to slow it down or ease the symptoms at
&gt; best.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone with a particular interest in healing, along
&gt; with a good measure of progress in Hermetics know the answers
&gt; to any of the following questions:
&gt;
&gt; Q. can MS be treated successfully at this time
&gt; by Hermetic means (given Group Karma)?
&gt; Q. What is the root cause of the illness, and can
&gt; it protected against by persons untrained in Hermetics?
&gt; Q. Assuming it can be treated by Hermetics, any ideas
&gt; what form the treatment would take?
&gt;
&gt; I realise these are very specific queries and tie in with
&gt; an advanced application of the Hermetics skills developed in
&gt; IIH, but MS is ever increasing across the Western World and
&gt; medical science has no clue as to cause or cure.
&gt;
&gt; Even with clear answers to all three questions, there's little
&gt; I can personally do for a further 10 years at least, but it
&gt; would be inspiring to know what the potential developments
&gt; in this field of medicine are likely to be, and whether my
&gt; future training would help at all.
&gt;
&gt; Any insight offered, most welcome.
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards
&gt;
&gt; Richard Scott
