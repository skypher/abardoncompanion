<tt>Hello. &quot;Averice&quot; != &quot;Ambition&quot; . It is ambitious to desire to complete the 
IIH. COnsider that most would not even approach it.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>To desire reflection of our own existance in the world around us via 
&quot;admiration&quot;, &quot;Affirmation&quot;, &quot;accomplishment&quot;, etc. is not necessarily based 
in an EMPTY SHELL of lust and depraved grasping. Perhaps we can see the use 
of it and sense its value in its sphere and not necessarily be BLINDLY 
ATTACHED/ENSLAVED to it.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>To wish to influence material (inner/outer) reality from within, is also the 
ambition to know oneself. It is not &quot;Money&quot; that &quot;is the root of all evil&quot; 
(... Evil is not the same as &quot;Sin&quot;, btw). It is the LOVE of it. THere is a 
difference. The difference is within. The tangles become more subtle as you 
see through the first more crude ones. THe work is never ending.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Your desire to know your own limits within the culture as it understands 
success and power/influence is perhaps your desire to understand yourself 
with the cultural tools that are most easily available and recognised. (for 
the interest of babe's?.. is this the success marker?).</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>You probably note how certain members of the population, aside form their 
rational intellectualized understanding of the meaninglessness of their 
reactions to your possible &quot;title&quot; or &quot;BIG MONEY&quot;, still EMOTIVELY REACT 
with interest to your ambition and what it MAY represent..people like 
DOERS. THey are attracted and allow themselves to be influenced by leaders 
who are action oriented.. its often more &quot;sexy&quot; to them. People want to feel 
like doers via association with doers. Its easier and often aides them to DO 
themselves.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>THat may make it more sexy and interesting to you to accomplish b/c you 
desire to be 'seen' as that and be envied. bragging rights. It gets 
attention... makes you feel powerful and makes your horemones move in your 
blood stream. You feel alive. Its addictive. Blind addiciton may be your 
fear.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Perhaps the REAL key is understanding your relationship with your negative 
traits and determining what positive trait is trying to be materialized 
through the confusion that is the negative representation of it.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>WHat is the &quot;fear personality&quot; of the &quot;true source&quot; of the attribute? If the 
negative trait was a skin covering a positive trait, what would the negative 
trait be guarding from harm or trying to usurp? Much like our personality 
covering our more refined self which must speak through it.THe personality 
desires to know itself as in control and MUST act this way when its on its 
own b/c it was designed to be active within this sphere of activity in 
materialisation. The guardian/servant may become the imprisoning master via 
its own ignorance and fear of death. Consider your specific traits as the 
same &quot;cell group&quot;.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I suppose the question is.. if the negative trait was a guardian, what would 
it protect as well as imprison if all one could see was the guardian and not 
that which it guarded?</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Have you ever tried to personify yourself (in meditiation) AS the traits 
SEPERATELY and reflect upon your own function? Reflect upon your own 
relation to the &quot;guard&quot; or what was being guarded?</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">As you probably noted, one of my 'demons' may be &quot;Babble&quot;.. ;)</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">THank you.

Subject: [BardonPraxis] Earthly Ambitions
Date: Mon, 16 Feb 2004 17:41:07 -0000</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Dear Friends,</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I am now making the list of my negative traits as suggested by
Bardon in his Chapter I of IIH. I have a question particularly about
one issues: my &quot;earthly&quot; ambitions. In other words, I am quite a
careeristic person. I am determined to succeed in whichever career I
choose to pursue after graduating from University. And to be totally
honest with myself, the main reasons of this is money. In fact, it's
even naughtier: money, power, respect, sense of security and feeling
of belonging to society (it is not easy to write these words, but it
is so). I was not raised in a Christian family, and have never
therefore considered money as bad or something that can hinder you
spiritual growth.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">*Now is it in itself a negative trait?* If it is, then I am prepared
to change it. At this point it seems very difficult, but I know that
eventually with time and spiritual develpoment I will be able to
overcome this obstacle. However, I feel that if I don't fully
understand what exactly is wrong about it, overcoming this desire
will be harder.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I will add that I'm not totally materialistic. I don't believe that
money only can bring you happiness, I will not hurt others to earn
money and I do not judge people by their socio-economical status.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I have always believed that money is neither bad nor good. The uses
that people do of it can be. And if the person is determined to live
a moral life then he will use the money to help others, and let's
don't get realistic, if your motives are pure then there is so much
you can do for the good of humanity if you have money. Nevertheless,
something tells me that this ambition needs to be written down under
the heading of negative traits.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">*In which ways do you think I could transfer this ambition into a
positive trait?* I understand that this what we are supposed to do
with our negative sides.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">I would love to hear your opinions.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Thanks,
David</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">PS
I am not talking about having enough money to be able to buy food
and to ensure that you children get a decent education, I am rather
talking about BIG MONEY :-)</pre><br>
