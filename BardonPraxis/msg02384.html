<pre>Hermetic initiation as Bardon presented it is not about following

Thank you Rawn! This is the True revelation of the path of Magic. Each 
individual follows his abilities and finds solace in his own discovery of the 
mysteries. It is not the same as I told you so rather that I know so!

Dear Joa,

&gt;&gt; I think that today it&#xB4;s inevitable for all the students of the 
occult to remember that exactly one hundred years ago (on 8th April 
1904), a young man called Aleister Crowley began to receive a 
supposed revelation in El Cairo (Egypt) from Aiwass, his Holy 
Guardian Angel: The Book of the Law. &lt;&lt;

While I don't mean to offend your own set of beliefs, you have 
greatly overstated when you use the words &quot;inevitable&quot; and &quot;all&quot; in 
this context. :)

&gt;&gt; It seems that Bardon had a great respect for &quot;The Great Beast&quot;
because there&#xB4;s a passage in IIH that has clearly the crowleian
influence: &quot;Love is the Law, Love under Will&quot;. Bardon wrote this, but
curiously he didn&#xB4;t make any
mention about Crowley. &lt;&lt;

That phrase is not original to Crowley. But even if he was in fact
quoting Crowley, there's no indication of exactly how Bardon felt 
about Crowley.

&gt;&gt; I haven&#xB4;t got very clear what is the &quot;bardonist&quot;:) attitude on
Crowley. Did Bardon believe in the authenticity of that &quot;revelation&quot;?
What was really his opinion about Crowley and what was the real 
grade of influence of Crowley on Bardon in the creation of IIH? &lt;&lt;

Bardon didn't say.

&gt;&gt; Rawn, I have observed that you don&#xB4;t make any mention on Crowley 
(for example in your &quot;anotated bibliography&quot; there is not any book of
Crowley. To me, this is highly surprising because his influence on 
FB is evident, like I said before). Do you consider him a black 
magician? What is your personal opinion about him and his system of 
training? Can you clarify me these points? &lt;&lt;

Personally, I find no value in Crowley's writings and I do not see 
any &quot;evidence&quot; of his influence upon Bardon's system.

Hermetic initiation as Bardon presented it is not about following
another person's revelation. Instead, it is about empowering the
student's own abilities to attain their own personal &quot;revelations&quot;.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
