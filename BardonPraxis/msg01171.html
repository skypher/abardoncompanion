<pre>You have finished step one ? Then, maybe you can use autosuggestion 
with benefits.

I read few books from Joseph Murphy. He is quiet famous when it comes 
to people who have done researsh about the subconscious mind.
I read in his book he had himself a desastrous disease. He explained 
by using correctly the law of his subconscious mind, he healed.

I read in his books many testimony of people who healed from really 
dangerous diseases. Murphy became famous in many countries, and his 
books are references on the subject.
I suggest you read &quot;the power of the subconscious mind&quot; (guess it's 
the right title or something close).

I tried the methods written in his books and i can tell you it worked 
very well for me.
Those techniques are easy to performs.

I don't wanna give you false hope, but these teachings helped many 
people (and sometime saved their life), so why won't it be useful for 
you ?

I really hope things will get better.

I may have other informations, as i know some people very involved 
about alternate medicine. Are you looking for specific technics ?
then i can give you some suggestions, maybe. Let me know.

&gt; Hi Rodolfo,
&gt; 
&gt; I am afraid my post has led us far off the topic of Bardon.
&gt; I will indulge in just one last post on this topic.
&gt; 
&gt; I am well informed on my decision to stop my sons medication. Two 
specialist
&gt; doctors have shown me that they firstly don't agree with each other 
and
&gt; secondly, when it comes to the human brain, they are just making 
educated
&gt; guesses as to what medication to give.
&gt; 
&gt; At least in South Africa practicing medicine has become a quest for 
money.
&gt; Patients are exposed to life threatening procedures just to extort 
more
&gt; money from health insurance.
&gt; 
&gt; It is a pity we cannot get more scientists hooked on the Work of 
Bardon.
&gt; 
&gt; You have the opportunity to integrate the medical and Hermetic 
disciplines.
&gt; You will have results far greater than medical science alone could 
ever hope
&gt; achieve.
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks for your concern.
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards
&gt; 
&gt; Johan

&gt; Dear Johan:
&gt; As a medicine student I suggest you should have a good conversation 
with
&gt; your phisician before interrupting any treatment. There are lots of 
herbal
&gt; treatments that help, but one should be careful in changing drugs 
for herbs.
&gt; There are lots of scientific evidences that drives phisician's 
therapeutics.
&gt; I hope your son will aways be healthy.
&gt; 
&gt; Rodolfo
