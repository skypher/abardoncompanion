<pre>Dear Peter,

&gt;&gt; You're response is quite surprising, and quite synchronous to say the
very least. &lt;&lt;

;)

&gt;&gt; I have been acting in accord primarily with the second and third
options by working fairly diligently upon the current steps within IIH
that I have been working on, &lt;&lt;

Good! :) It's *essential* that you continue your IIH progress if you
wish to progress with KTQ.

&gt;&gt; after I had a little bit of an epiphany concerning Bardon's statement
about learning the letters like a child. Which is an extremely true
statement, but also one with considerable depth that goes beyond what
Bardon talks about ithin
KTQ, I believe. I'm sure you already know something along these lines,
but I'm sure some others would benefit seeing how all of the labours of
IIH seem to fit into the greater picture of the work of Kaballah. &lt;&lt;

What followed was beautifully written! Would you agree to my including
it (credited to you, of course) in my next website update of the
Correspondence section? As you say, others will benefit from what
you've written.

&gt;&gt; Thirdly, the scholar learns the language of the electric and the
magnetic fluids. Which is not really something that I can comment
overly much about, though it does make me wonder why Bardon placed
the work with the fluids so late within IIH when he has the scholar
working with combined forms of these qualities for some time. &lt;&lt;

Just like you mention further on about the progression of steps to
learning the direct perception of essential meaning, the same
incremental process, starting from the densest layer and moving upwards
to the more and more ephemeral, is applied. You start with the VE which
is a dense Elemental composite. Then you move up the ladder of density
to the Elements and learn to master them. The experience with the
Elements leads you to the perception of the Fluids and their mastery.
When you manipulate the Fluids, the Elements follow in accordance, so
this is a &quot;higher&quot; form of magic. Without the Elemental work as a
prerequisite, it would be VERY difficult to master the Fluids.

&gt;&gt; With the meditative exercises of thought control one is working on
quieting the rational mind enough so that it can perceive essential
meaning, and in fact, true vacancy of mind can produce a perception of
essential meaning. Though this perception of essential meaning is again
one that is generally filtered for some reason that I do not quite
understand. &lt;&lt;

This is the boundary between *perception* and *interpretation*.
Interpretation by the lower aspects of mind kicks in almost instantly.
This is the part of mind that first *recognizes* the perception, which
is an act that pulls the perception out of its infinite setting and down
into the realm of the finite. Otherwise, the brain would have no way of
processing it. As you get more and more comfortable with the direct
perception, you will more easily straddle the fence between realms, so
to speak, and even learn to place your awareness in that microsecond
between infinite perception and the beginning of finite interpretation.
Nonetheless, you must always return to the lower levels of awareness so
it's wise to learn the Art of integrating the higher perceptions into
those layers.

&gt;&gt; In KTQ Bardon calls for an accumulation of light within both the
heart and the brain, yet in IIH Bardon repeatedly warns that an
accumulation of the elements within those two regions is something that
shouldn't be attempted except by the scholar that has attained the
faculty of clairvoyance, through which they would be able to see the
functioning of the internal organs. While the faculty of clairvoyance is
something that is highly dependent upon the ability of direct perception
I'm not quite sure that I'm at that level to be able to perceive such
potential subtle imbalances. Despite the fact that years ago I prepared
the fire fluid condenser and used it as a poultice for some time along
with trying to impregnate my eyes with the faculty of clairvoyance to
not avail. Or is creating an accumulation of light different from an
accumulation of the elements? &lt;&lt;

Yes, the Lights are different than the Elements and Fluids. They stand
in relation to the Fluids in the same way that the Fluids do to the
Elements. An accumulation and condensation of the Lights that
correspond to brain and heart, within those organs will not cause a
disruption of their electrical functions in the way that a similar
accumulation of an Element or Fluid could. The Lights interact with the
universal materia in a somewhat different manner than do the Elements
and Fluids.

&gt;&gt; When working with the first stage of the fire pole working with the
letters definitely did produce an accumulation within the body, yet it
is an accumulation that seemed softer and gentler than an accumulation
of the elements, even though it was just as dynamic. Then again, that
might also be due to the fact that I was working with the A which has a
feeling of ease attached to it. &lt;&lt;

The Water pole correspondences aside, there is a difference in the
quality of an accumulation of the various Lights. For example the 'C'
(tzaddi) is very fiery with its vermillion red and the 'Ch' (Cheth) with
its sparkling silvery violet, is very invigorating and alive, in
comparison with the expansive 'A' (aleph) with its sky blue. But the
quantity of stress (i.e., the dynamic force) that each of these
different flavors of accumulated Light bring to the body is the same.

&gt;&gt; Physiologically speaking, the eyes are an extension of a brain. So is
it okay for a person who is just starting to accumulate the elements
within specific parts of the body within the eyes? &lt;&lt;

Yes.

&gt;&gt; More questions to come when I have the time to type them all out. :)
&lt;&lt;

As I stated in my KTQ Commentary, there are limits to what I'm willing
to discuss regarding KTQ, in public. Some of your questions have
already taken me right up to the boarder of my limits and I've debated
whether to answer you here on the BardonPraxis, or to answer you in
private instead. So don't be surprised if I end up answering some of
your future questions here, in public, and some in private, through
direct correspondence. :)

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
