<pre>Hi Geoffrey,

&gt; The IIH goal is for us to bind together with the Divine 
&gt; Providence. 
&gt; But why in doing this needs a lot of work, patience and 
&gt; determination? Why does the Divine Providence makes it difficult 
&gt; to achieve? I don't seek answers but letting out a *sigh*.

I don't think that the goal of IIH is to bind us together with the 
Divine Providence. And in general Hermetic terms, I don't really 
think that our final goal is the Divine Providence. The Divine 
Providence is a very high concept, but not the highest.

It is, however, the return of the creation to the creator the 
ultimate goal. The bind with everything. The evolution...

Let me give you a more scientific aproach: the evolution of species!

If you understand basic biology, you would know that life has 
appeared from a single molecule that had one unique hability: to 
reproduce. It could make an exact copy of itself!!

Well, almost exact... If that copy were that perfect, life as we 
know it, could never been involved. It was the error that allowed 
new things to appear. And from those many errors, good things and 
bad things occured. Mostly bad, but one or another were so good that 
were simply an evolution of his progenitor.

So, as you can see, it is the trial and error, the experimentation, 
that allow meverything to improve. Evolution cannot take place if 
there are no experimentations, no errors, no doubts. If everything 
were easy, then, you'll be god himself ;)

But because things are hard you learn with them. You start to 
understand them. And, you can't simply want to understand a thing 
that you've not lived or experimented. This applies to good and bad. 
To suffer and joy. To all the relative and absolute poles.

Take another example as the martial arts. In here you have to train 
hard, you have to be beaten hard. You have to suffer pain and 
distress. You have to learn to crawl, before you learn to walk. For 
those who are capable of learning with that are the true warriors.

It's the dynamic of the universe that generates life. Life, itself, 
must be dynamic. The energy must flow and can't be stopen (Newton 
law of movement: a body that as acquired a linear and constant 
movement, remains in move until a force actes in it; Relative 
dynamic also postulates that: there are no absolute points, no 
absolute referencial. Everything is related to another. Nothing is 
really stoped because movement MUST BE measured against something)...

You must be willing to fight the &quot;good combat&quot;, for everyone there 
is a chance, but only those who will to fight it have taken the path 
of return to the creator.

Light and peace,

Hugo Jose Ferreira
