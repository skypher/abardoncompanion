<pre>Hi David,

I have followed your current questions with real interest, because it
probably reflects something that all of us have to go through - to one
degree or another. A lot could be said in reply to your questions, but I
wish to address one part of your doubts - that about a need for a Master. I
have been in spiritual practice for over 30 years, in both the Buddhist and
'Hindu' paths. I is my direct experience that: (1) Your development
depends upon what YOU bring to the practice - not the qualities or presence
of a Master. Over the years I have known many people who have lived with a
Master(s) and not gained anything from it. And I have known others who have
had very little contact with a Master, but Realized the True nature of their
Being. (2) If and when you need a Master one WILL appear and it will not
have anything to do with your seeking one. It will be given to you. So
relax. Get out of your head!! Do something physical to get your self
grounded. Enjoy. (3) Your seeking for Enlightenment is the biggest block to
your Enlightenment! It is the great knot the must be cut. A little advise -
do not seek Enlightenment - which is a concept of mind, but rather be
devoted to Truth - not truth of some concept (mind), but Truth as IT IS in
this and ever moment right where you are . This will take you much further
than seeking something called Enlightenment. Once again relax and enjoy -
you will and are receiving everything that you need. Right now you are just
suffering a mind fart :).

Delight,

Roger

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; --- In BardonPraxis@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rawn Clark&quot; &lt;rawnclark@n...&gt;
&gt; wrote:
&gt; &gt; Dear David,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I want to begin by suggesting that IIH is not the path for you. If
&gt; &gt; after 5 months of involvement you express these sorts of doubts
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; the path you're pursuing then, to my mind at least, this is a pretty
&gt; &gt; clear sign that you're not following a path that resonates with
&gt; you. :)
&gt; &gt; Perhaps Buddhism would be the better choice for you?
&gt;
&gt; After ruminating a great deal today, I think I have realized a few
&gt; things.
&gt;
&gt; First of all, this is a pattern with me. I embark on a certain path
&gt; (not just spiritual, but a pursuit or hobby) with great enthusiasm,
&gt; enthusiasm which is based on the belief that through this path I will
&gt; become a far better person than before -- better than anyone else, in
&gt; fact. I have realized that this is based on deep-rooted self-pity
&gt; and insecurity.
&gt;
&gt; So, as such, I guess it has nothing to do with Bardon. Instead it
&gt; has to do with my need to give my power away to something that I
&gt; expect will endow me with superhuman ability, be it amazing psychic
&gt; powers or enlightenment, in the easiest way possible. It has to do
&gt; with my insecurity with myself where I am. The grass is always
&gt; greener on the other side of the fence.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Intellectual laziness and the making of assumptions that are based
&gt; upon
&gt; &gt; the most superficial of understandings is anathema to the pursuit
&gt; of ANY
&gt; &gt; path to enlightenment. In all of these statements I see gross
&gt; &gt; misunderstandings of all the disciplines you've named.
&gt;
&gt; ouch! Well, I WAS trying to elicit some constructive criticism. :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This leads to
&gt; &gt; incorrect assumptions especially when you start comparing one poorly
&gt; &gt; understood philosophy with another poorly understood philosophy.
&gt;
&gt; well, that's very true.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Within each of these statements I see a desire held by many folks --
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; desire for an easy way that doesn't take any work. A way that is
&gt; fully
&gt; &gt; explained and which doesn't challenge the intellect, will,
&gt; &gt; self-confidence, etc., at all. But such a path, were it to exist
&gt; (and I
&gt; &gt; can assure that it does NOT exist), would also be of absolutely no
&gt; &gt; value. ANY path to enlightenment is a path strewn with hard work.
&gt; &gt; Enlightenment itself is indeed infinitely simplistic but the path
&gt; *to*
&gt; &gt; enlightenment is complex and laborious.
&gt;
&gt; I think one of the things that triggered this self-doubt for me is
&gt; this: I was talking with friend of mine who is a Buddhist
&gt; practitioner. We were talking about meditation, and I asked him
&gt; about the necessity for a teacher. He said that in his opinion a
&gt; teacher was absolutely essential for proper practice, because
&gt; otherwise you are groping in the dark. That is when I became really
&gt; concerned for my lack of guidance, and really insecure and faithless
&gt; about my ability to guide myself.
&gt;
&gt; Is this an issue, then? Do people with a teacher whom they can talk
&gt; to in person every day or every week have an advantage over people
&gt; who don't? ...
&gt;
&gt; I suppose the question is (thinking out loud), why do I care if I am
&gt; at a disadvantage, who am I trying to beat ... ?
&gt;
&gt; I would like to say that I do feel that my feelings of being
&gt; overwhelmed by the amount of information in Bardonian magic are
&gt; valid. But I am realizing that the wealth of information and details
&gt; to learn seems no less than, say, in Mahayana Buddhism. You are
&gt; right Rawn, it's not really good to compare one poorly understood
&gt; philosophy with another.
&gt;
&gt; But herein lies the question: If I lack the wisdom to make a
&gt; decision, and all of my previous decisions were based on personal
&gt; desires rather than deep understanding, than how can I make a
&gt; decision? It seems that I am always making choices that are ego-
&gt; driven and lacking all of the information. that's life right? Man.
&gt; Acknowledging that all paths are equivalent in their essence but
&gt; different in their flavors, does that mean choosing a path that seems
&gt; right initially and then committing to it for at least a certain
&gt; period of time, until I have learned enough to know? I've heard it
&gt; said that one should achieve black belt rank in a single martial art
&gt; before considering integrating any other fighting styles into their
&gt; repertoire, in order to have a firm foundation and basis for good
&gt; judgment. Might the same apply to the spiritual paths?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; David
