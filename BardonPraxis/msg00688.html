<pre>Dear dustovshio,

Although I'm only at level 2, and that it is not the place of a 
newbie to offer advice, I decided to answer your post because I 
happened to face some of the questions you seem to be wondering 
about.

&lt;&lt;I don't know if my gray hair and facial acne is caused by 
meditation.&gt;&gt;

As far as the gray hairs are concerned, I don't thing so. First, 
because I know lots of people who meditate a lot and don't have gray 
hairs, and others who got gray hairs between 20 and 25 years of age 
(myself included), and were not meditating at that time.
So I would be surprised to hear that there is a correlation between 
*meditation* per se and gray hairs.

&lt;&lt;I am 22 years old&gt;&gt;

Lucky you :-) How dare you :-)

&lt;&lt;and have a feeling that the gray hair is caused by concentrating 
too much energy in the head area.&gt;&gt;

Energy is something else. I also have (and always had) lots of 
energy at the level of the Head, and I got gray hairs relatively 
soon also. But again: *I got them before I started meditating*. 

When I told the above to some naturopaths I met, I was answered 
that &quot;early gray hairs&quot; may be due to other problems: smoking, lack 
of balance in diet etc.; don't recall the wording exactly. 
Couldn't the fact that you have acne point to diet ?

&lt;&lt; Furthermore, Bardons exercises seem to create pressure in the 
head and 3rd eye area, and this makes me uncomfortable and disrupts 
my concentration&gt;&gt;

I know the feeling. It reached quite a critical level in my case, 
and this took place after I started meditating ...but *before* I 
started IIH : strong pain at the 3rd eye level, I heard my 
fontanelle cracking when I closed the eyes (!), it even killed a 
nerve in a teeth, etc.etc. - I don't want to elaborate. However, 
what *really* helped in my case was the following :

- the first step in solving a problem is to stop worsening it. I 
don't know whether you are used drinking lots of coffee or 
other &quot;acidity/fire&quot; inducing drinks, but you may want to decrease 
your consumption for a while - just to see the result. And it may 
help at the &quot;gray hairs&quot; level :-)

- Sounds stupid, but don't forget to drink enough water. Before the 
meditation and after.

- Rawn's Archaeous (downloadable) indicates how to release energy to 
the Earth. Try it. And the exercises themselves helped me *a lot*, 
by allowing me to &quot;meet&quot; my astral and mental bodies :-)

- ...IIH. I suggest you work intensively on your mirrors: working on 
the imbalanced helped quite rapidly in my case, by allowing energy 
to be shared on a better way among the different regions. It even 
started improving at the writing of the mirrors. This said, I'm 
still at level 2, because there is a lot to be corrected :-) 

- The following point helped me, but I guess it will need validation 
from the advanced students :-) : during your meditation, don't &quot;be&quot; 
at the level of your head only, even (especially) if you feel a 
pain. Try to situate yourself at the abdomen level also (hence the 
importance of drinking) and share your consciousness among your 
entire body.

- Don't take this as a medical advice (because I'm no doctor :-) : 
again, you may want to determine whether your diet is balanced, and 
to try to avoid acid inducing food. I'm not saying an imbalanced 
diet is the *cause* of your concern - I just think it may especially 
be important in your case to check it, maybe because of your level 
of energy. 

- Acne. Couldn't an increase of acne just mean that your blood is 
purging itself ? A reason more to drink enough water :-)

Thanks for yoru patience. 
Now, I look forward reading the other answers you'll receive, 
because I'm still interested :-)

Cheers
NB
