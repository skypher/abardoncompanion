Hello Rawn,

How much time can be extended the exercises of step 1? One hour,
&gt; for example?
&quot;I recommend that you follow the guidelines Bardon offered in that
&gt; regard&quot;

Well, but Bardon doesn&#xB4;t say how much time should last an exercise. He only
says how much time should last the control of the exercise itself (for
example, ten minutes in the case of the thought control exercise.)

&quot;Suppose that in my work with the soul mirrors I have found that I
&gt; have vertigo or fear of the heights. Can be a good idea to expose myself
&gt; to extreme experiences (for example, climbing mountains) to overcoming
&gt; that negative trait? (of course, mixing the action with the
&gt; autosuggestion) &lt;&lt;
&gt; It couldn't hurt. :)

I am afraid I didn&#xB4;t explain myself very well. What I wanted to say is if
there can be negative traits that can&#xB4;t be beaten only for autosuggestion
and it could be necessary be devoted to action.

I have three questions more:

You say that behind a negative trait there&#xB4;s always something positive
hidden. Well, I don&#xB4;t understand very well that idea. I don&#xB4;t see what
positiveness can be behind such things like hate, low autoesteem,
aggresiveness, etc. Could you explain it?

You say that the atribution of the traits to a particular element must be
done in function of the root traits. But what if ALL your root traits
pertain to a same element? The psique is a complex puzzle, but all its
elements are related. Can be possible that ALL your negative traits pertain,
for example, to the fire element?

You say that the changing of the traits will balance the Elemental
composition regardless of whether or not you have assigned the items
correctly. Then, is the Elemental division totally irrelevant or has it
importance in the higher steps?

Thanks again, Rawn :)

JOA

&gt;
&gt; Dear Joa,
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; As I said I am very sad about your retirement, and I would like to
&gt; make you some questions before I never can communicate with you again.
&gt; :( &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; As I pointed out to Go, folks will still be able to contact me by
&gt; visiting <a  href="../Contact.html">http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/Contact.html</a>
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) Lying on a bed with the hands on the abdomen, can be a good form
&gt; of working all the exercises of IIH or not? Is it better, from the very
&gt; beginning, adopt a sitting position of the yoga? I have great doubts
&gt; about this. &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Ultimately, you want to be able to accomplish the exercises no matter
&gt; what position your body is in so that means it is wise to work with
&gt; different positions, some comfortable and some not, so that you will
&gt; learn to control your mind and its reactions to your bodily position,
&gt; under any circumstance. On the other hand, it is also good to find a
&gt; position that you are comfortable in and let that be your *usual*
&gt; working position.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) Why is it necessary awaiting to the step 2 for changing a negative
&gt; trait character? I think that if I am conscious of a negative trait
&gt; character I have the moral obligation of changing it from THAT moment,
&gt; because, what if I never reach the step 2? &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; The reasoning behind it is that you don't have an accurate and holistic
&gt; map of your character traits until you have completed your Soul Mirror
&gt; lists. Until the Mirror is finished you don't have a comprehensive
&gt; understanding of the overall context within which that individual
&gt; character trait exists. Furthermore, the other exercises in Step One
&gt; teach you the rudiments of the Step Two techniques that are applied to
&gt; the character transformation work.
&gt;
&gt; Ultimately though, the decision is yours to make.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3) I practice the &quot;thought control&quot; exercise twice a day. I have
&gt; attained a better control of my mind, and it is relatively easy for me
&gt; to get my thoughts as if they were coming from a remote distance. This
&gt; is so the greater part of the days, but NOT all the days. Can I consider
&gt; that the exercise is dominated? (By the way, the second time of the day
&gt; is more difficult to me to reach that state) &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; I suggest that you move on to the second mental exercise and in that way
&gt; test whether or not you have mastered the first exercise sufficiently.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 4) How much time can be extended the exercises of step 1? One hour,
&gt; for example? &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; I recommend that you follow the guidelines Bardon offered in that
&gt; regard.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; 5) Suppose that in my work with the soul mirrors I have found that I
&gt; have vertigo or fear of the heights. Can be a good idea to expose myself
&gt; to extreme experiences (for example, climbing mountains) to overcoming
&gt; that negative trait? (of course, mixing the action with the
&gt; autosuggestion) &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; It couldn't hurt. :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; a) Can they be an adecuate tool to discover the True Will or that is
&gt; another subject that has nothing to do with the soul mirrors working? &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; The Soul Mirror work, or rather the *character transformation* work is
&gt; the first step in uncovering what you have labeled your &quot;true will&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; b) I am very surprised with your commentary (and with the Bardon&#xB4;s
&gt; one)when you say, in your commentary upon IIH, that the initial process
&gt; of self-analysis must be done in a time limit of one to two weeks. &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Neither of us stated that it *must* be done in that time frame but it is
&gt; an ideal amount of time for the reasons I stated in my commentary. Your
&gt; Soul Mirror is not a one-shot deal where you do it once and that one
&gt; time has to be perfect. Quite the contrary -- it is a lifelong process
&gt; and your Soul Mirror is always evolving. It is more important that you
&gt; move forward in the process than that you get it absolutely perfect the
&gt; first time around. :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; c) I have seen very clearly that the traits tend to go full circle
&gt; and end where they started. And there are six or seven traits that
&gt; influence or are the root of many of the others. But when I finish my
&gt; work, what can be the more adecuate strategy to attack the &quot;spider&#xB4;s
&gt; web&quot;, all this enormous puzzle? &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; As Bardon suggested, begin work with one of those six or seven major
&gt; negative traits. By pulling that one thread, many others will unravel
&gt; simultaneously.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, Rawn, thank you VERY much for your patience and support. And
&gt; good luck!!! :) &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks. :)
&gt;
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
