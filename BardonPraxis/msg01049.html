<pre>Dear Rawn,

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes. You could &quot;learn the Letters&quot; but not utter them 
Kabbalistically. In other words, when it came to working the First 
Key, you'd hit a brick wall. To utter the Letters Kabbalistically 
requires considerably more than just &quot;learning the Letters&quot;.&lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt;From what I've read, one would to unify with the divine. Something 
that I'm quite a ways away from, though I guess working with TMO IHVH-
Adonai with regards to the raising of consciousness is one expression 
of such unificaiton with the divine.

Yet, at the same time, with &quot;learning the Letters&quot; one learns how to 
condense them dynamically in a manner equivelent to the work with the 
Elements and Vital energy in IIH. Can not one use this sort of 
accumulation to effect changes as when working with the Elements? How 
would such a work differ from the Single Letter Key?

&gt;&gt;&gt;:) Is it any wonder to you now that Bardon spoke of the connection
between magic and mysticism? Magic leads to a mystical outlook . . . 
it moves one to poetry because this is often the only way to even 
begin expressing the deeper reality.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Actually, it's a quote from William Blake, I believe. Though, 
personally I am very much of a poet. I've produced a number of poems 
relating to my practice in Hermetics. Not exactly sure they'd be 
appropriate to be posted here though.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Whether or not it was &quot;safer&quot; would depend upon your facility with 
the Elements. Once mastered, the Elements are &quot;safe&quot;.&lt;&lt;&lt;

I was specifically wondering about the application of the Lights and 
the Elements upon another person.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Exactly! :) It's again the same pattern of progression illustrated 
by the IIH work. One begins with learning how to recognize the 
Universal Qualities as they manifest within one's own self, then how 
they manifest externally. Then one turns to manipulating those 
Universal Qualities, quantitatively within the own self and then 
externally. This personalizes the Universal.&lt;&lt;&lt;

So how does learning how to recognize these Universal Qualities and 
then start to apply them differ from uttering the Letters 
Kabbalahistically? Even without being able to utter the Letters 
Kabbalahistically, I can see that having a deep understanding of the 
Universal Qualities and how they manifest would be a great asset to 
the magician.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Hallelujah! ;-) You are the first person to reply in this way to 
that statement! In every other case, I've received either a passive
acceptance or a querulous rebellion, but never actual 
understanding.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Well, there is a first for everything! :)

Now, more questions:

Part of the reason why I feel I've progressed up to this level of 
being able to percieve essential meaning is due to the fact that I've 
worked rather extensivly with the Archeaous, TMO IHVH-adonai, and the 
CSM. All of which deal with essential meaning in one way shape or 
form. Which would all seem to relate to the Fourth Tarot card because 
of this.

With the Archeaous, when the three bodies are seperated, one is able 
to see varying degrees of essential meaning. Which is really 
interesting when you compare it to the various steps within IIH where 
Bardon doesn't start an active seperation of the three bodies until 
step 7. Yet, with the Archeaous one is able to achieve seperation and 
integration of the three bodies when one has only attained step two. 
When one attains the elemental balance work of step four, actual 
astral and mental wandering.

TMO IHVH introduces the tripolar action through the unified three 
bodies. In addition to introducing a number of different levels of 
consciousness and how to move between them. Which naturally starts to 
produce a wider scope of vision. With the most recent lesson within 
TMO IHVH I can definetly see how it works with essential meaning.

While I haven't worked with the CSM as much as I have with the 
Archeaou and TMO IHVH, it seems fairly obvious that when one looks at 
the tapestry that is the self, one has to be able to percieve 
essential meaning. Otherwise, if one is not able to percieve 
essential meaning, one would never be able to see the whole of the 
self.

Now, Bardon also states that one shouldn't let other's know one's 
rituals for a variety of reasons. Yet here on your website you have 
quite a number of rituals. So, what's going on?

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
