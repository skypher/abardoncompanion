<pre>Hi Vovin,

Thanks for the thoughts, they were helpful. The reason I started redoing my
mirror was because it was too general like you say. It could have been
anyone's mirror because just writing down anger for example doesn't say much
about my personality as such. So I'm trying to delve deeper and see how I
personally relate to those &quot;general&quot; traits. It's quite interesting how that
make you look at yourself subjectively and in a way disassociate from the
self you are. It reminds me of the Tipheret self in the 8TM, I'm finding the
soul mirror work very enriching.

Best wishes,
Vania

&gt; Dear Vania ~
&gt;
&gt; Mmmmm... It sounds as if you are well on your way to understanding
&gt; what all this soul-mirror work is all about.
&gt;
&gt; You are reaching the stage where it isn't a mechanical procedure any
&gt; longer; when Bardon's exercises take fruit is when it becomes a real
&gt; tangible thing within the student hirself, rather than trite &quot;school-
&gt; work&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; A major step is when the student realizes that it is *hir* Self
&gt; he/she is dealing with; *hir* universe. This is when the
&gt; blueprint/diagram comes to life, and real interaction begins between
&gt; the work and the life.
&gt;
&gt; I think perhaps that it is better to understand that your soul-mirror
&gt; is *yours*, rather than trying to generalize *your* personality to
&gt; include everybody. While fears/desires may indeed be the most common
&gt; roots of elemental imbalance, it does little good trying to force
&gt; your own soul-mirror into a generic scope.
&gt;
&gt; Just the same, it will become less and less fruitful to ask others if
&gt; your own personal discoveries from the soul-mirror work is correct or
&gt; not. Other people can only teach you the techniques -the hows; the
&gt; whys are all about *you*.
&gt;
&gt; For whatever it's worth, I hope this helps somewhat.
&gt;
&gt; Well met
&gt; Vovin

&gt; &gt; HI Everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've recently started re-doing my soul mirrors so that they include
&gt; &gt; different occurences of a personality trait and also root causes of
&gt; those
&gt; &gt; traits. So I'm wondering whould my new mirrors should include both
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; 'cause and effect', in other words should I have both the rooth
&gt; cause AND
&gt; &gt; the resulting effects? Or should I only include the root causes?
&gt; &gt; An interesting thing I have noticed while working on finding the
&gt; root of a
&gt; &gt; trait, was that the majority of the root causes are either fears or
&gt; desires
&gt; &gt; based on our likes and dislikes. Am I missing something, is there
&gt; more to
&gt; &gt; it? I mean it's scary when I think that a person's behaviour can be
&gt; solely
&gt; &gt; based on fears/desires. What about babies? They don't have those?
&gt; Do they
&gt; &gt; act on survival inctincts alone because they don't have a
&gt; personality? Come
&gt; &gt; to think of it fears/desires are all rooted in inctinct, so is that
&gt; the one
&gt; &gt; root cause of our whole bahaviour? Is it instinct we're trying to
&gt; overcome
&gt; &gt; and thus transform out personality? I'm wondering though, because
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; fear/desire thing applies to the white mirror too, and so what are
&gt; we to
&gt; &gt; transform our personality into?
&gt; &gt; I'm very confused here, so any thoughts on the subject will be
&gt; greatly
&gt; &gt; appreciated.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Best wishes,
&gt; &gt; Vania
