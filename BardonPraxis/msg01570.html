<pre>Hi,

I think that without having fully mastered the steps of IIH you are going to
have trouble healing her yourself.

I can recommend Pranic Healing. I have just done the first course, and am
not able to help you just yet. You need a Pranic Healer who has done Pranic
Psychotherapy, or even better if the healer has done Pranic Crystal Healing.

You can visit www.pranichealing.org for more info and contact details of
your nearest pranic healer. Pranic healing can also be done at a distance.
If money is a problem then I can tell you that no good pranic healer will
refuse healing, even if it has to be done for free.

The healing can be done without her knowing, but it is much better if she is
aware and wants to be healed.
In this case even more so.

If you have any problems or questions feel free to e-mail me and I will
arrange everything further.

She is in a fortunate position to have someone who cares for her.

Best Regards

Johan Pretorius

I have a question for all of you, btw I think my introduction never got
posted but, I am Male 28yrs old, Ive been praticing the Bardon books for
well over six years now.. Im still not entirely masterd KTQ but I also go
back and repractice many of the different sections of all the books from
time to time.. My question is though, I have a friend of mine whom is a
young female, she has had a very hard life, been abused and misstreated, and
through such she has aquired a great many of Elemental and MENTAL
Imballances.. She is a good soul in her heart, but she has huge problems in
relating to the real world, and has no acceptable social skills, she also
has a problem with telling lies to try and impress others.. I had a short
affair with her which I hoped would last longer, as I can see her potential,
but she felt something for me which scared her, so she decided to end the
romantic part of the relationship.. My question is, do you have any
suggestions as how I can effectively help cure
her of her Mental/elemental imballances using either KTQ or IIH?.. and Is
it alright to do this without her knowledge of it? Thanks for all the input
Ive really enjoyed all the comments thus far since Ive joined the group.

Blessings to ye all.

Lord Horus.
