<pre>Regulus,

&gt; In recent years there has been a trend in the counseling community 
&gt; to distinguish psychological issues from spiritual ones. In the 
&gt; context of your previous posting what to do you think of this 
&gt; distinction? 

I'm not sure I understand your distinction between psychological and 
spiritual. To me, your examples -- reflecting on life, learning to 
care for others -- were both psychological and spiritual.

I think I have a sense of where you're coming from, though (correct 
me if I'm wrong): &quot;If all of these other things work well, why 
Bardon?&quot; Or, why climb Mt Everest if there's nothing to prove?

I guess on some level I feel that I have something to prove, or to 
express, by doing any particular thing. So, I think that a person 
should choose a path in order to express some part of him/herself. 
If your hypothetical man X does not have any drive to learn IIH, then 
perhaps he shouldn't.

On the other hand, your question prompted me to ask myself why I'm on 
this path. There are a lot of different little answers. I prefer a 
self-guided structure I can follow on my own time in my own way. I 
am attracted to learning how to contact my own life and soul more 
deeply. And I think special powers are &quot;cool.&quot; And lots of other 
things in between. Some of those things, like the negative, greedy 
aspect of attraction to special powers, I recognize as things that I 
should and will &quot;burn off&quot; as I do more work on my soul mirror, but 
they are there nonetheless. So I guess my final answer as to my 
wanting is: It's complex.

Personally, the bottom line for me is that if I weren't involved with 
Bardon, I would be involved with some kind of spiritual practice, as 
I have been since I was in high school (I think it runs in the 
family, though in very different ways -- my mom is a conservative 
Christian). So spiritual practice in general is an expression of who 
I am, and following this particular path is, for the moment, a 
refined expression of who I am. I refine and personalize it in order 
to incorporate it into my life, and it refines me in turn; and all of 
that is self-expression. Pursuing spirituality is for me a very 
fulfilling thing, in a bodily way -- like, for instance, the feeling 
of openness and nakedness when I am honest with myself and realize, 
with wrenching gut, that I've been engaging in a destructive pattern 
in my life. It's fun, in a deeper way. It's exciting. I feel 
good. I like the effects it has on my life; I feel happier and more 
balanced the more I do it. So I keep doing it.
:)


Hope this makes sense.

David
