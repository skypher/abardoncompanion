<pre>Dear Rawn,

Thank you for the link. While I have read that article before, it 
seems to have gained new depth since my work with KTQ and my 
advancement within IIH. From what I understand from that article, the 
work of PME is quite akin to that of KTQ in that one has to learn how 
to integrate the energies of the universal principles into the self 
and down to everyday existence. The work of mentally wandering to a 
sphere forces the scholar to integrate the quality of that sphere 
into their mental body via the impregination of the mental body with 
the light quality of that sphere. This integrates work integrates the 
grosser aspects of that sphere into the mental body, whereas actual 
contact with an individual spirit causes an interaction of a more 
subtler, specific quality of that sphere with the energies of the 
mental body. A work which naturally leads to those aspects of the 
universal principles working their way through the layers of 
existence to manifest in physicality.

This is the same sort of work that occurs within KTQ where one 
invokes specific qualities within the self in the form of the Letters 
as colour, tone, feeling and legality within the whole body, the 
elemental regions and the specific organs. Each exercise of invoking 
the Letters subtly changing the structure of the three bodies to 
become more in accord with the universal principles. The invoking of 
the letter with the transfer of consciousness to a specific organ or 
elemental region finalizing the transformation of that specific pole 
of the quadrapolar magnet. What Bardon doesn't seem to talk about 
within KTQ is that there are two ways of invoking the letter into a 
specific organ or elemental region: one would be letting ones 
consciousness enliven the whole organ or elemental region, whereas 
the other would be to transfer one's consciousness to the depth point 
of that organ and invoking the letter with the unified, three bodies 
of that organ alone. Both workings transform and integrate the 
universal qualities within the self, though I find that the latter 
form seems to transform and integrate these universal principles 
moreso than the other. I remember when I first invoked the letter 'A' 
into my lungs via the depth point. After dismissing the letter from 
my lungs they felt so strange that I kept on poking my lungs with my 
consciousness going, &quot;Are those my lungs? That doesn't feel like my 
lungs. I don't remember my lungs feeling like that before.&quot; And, 
after a little bit of meditation upon the matter I began to see how 
this work had changed the structure of the mental and astral materia 
and the structure of the mental and astral matrixs subtly to better 
express the universal quality of that letter within myself. Though I 
don't quite understand the specifics of this transformation, I know 
that it feels proper.

What I don't quite understand is how the condensation of a specific 
quality of light within the magical triangle into an astral density, 
and the evocation of a spirit into that atmosphere furthers that 
progression of the subtle mental energies manifesting themselves 
within physicality. Especially since, when doing as such, one is 
seperated from the spirit that is evoked by both the magical circle 
and the magical triangle.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
