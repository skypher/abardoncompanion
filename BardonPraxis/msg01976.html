<pre>Dear Pax,

This seems to also be a problem encountered with many
inexperienced healers (nothing implied here). It is
not only on a psychological level, but there is also
the possibility to open yourself to that person's
energies and carry them off with you. I believe it is
also possible for people to unconsciously drain your
energy or the mixing of auras? I'll let the experts
answer this one, though.

Rawn teaches several methods to build a shield for
yourself on his website.

There is also Karla Mclaren who puts out a cd called
Practical Protection and Renewel Skills for Healers,
Therapists, and Sensitive People. This might be very
helpful if you are pressed for time. Just pop in the
CD and go.

I have a few books on the subject, concerning
grounding yourself, clearing the area, cleansing your
energies, shielding, etc. for healers. Unfortunately,
I can't think of the titles and will have to get back
to you tonight when I get home.

Doing a search on google.com with aura protection or
spiritual grounding and it should bring up quite a few
useful techniques.

I am not a Therapist or Healer, etc. but this is just
information I've picked up from my own Healers and
Therapists. :-)

Sincerely,
Allen Kray

&gt; Ave!
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, so, my day job is psychiatrist. Why a person
&gt; of applied 
&gt; science is interested in magic and the occult is
&gt; another discussion. 
&gt; In this post I wish to ask for some advice in
&gt; dealing with a 
&gt; situation that is not only mental/emotional but very
&gt; possibly 
&gt; spiritual as well.
&gt; 
&gt; For some reason, the people I have seen in the past
&gt; few days with 
&gt; Holiday Depression seem to be both more numerous and
&gt; more severe than 
&gt; in recent years. I remember observing this
&gt; intensity several years 
&gt; ago. Maybe it follows some kind of cycle, or maybe
&gt; it is something 
&gt; that is sensitive to world events. Whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; Part of the training of every psychiatrist is
&gt; maintaining healthy 
&gt; emotional boundaries to prevent the disability that
&gt; would occur if 
&gt; one's empathy actually led to contagion of all the
&gt; pain and chaos one 
&gt; encounters every day. Allowing patients' strong
&gt; emotions to be 
&gt; contagious can be absolutely crippling.
&gt; 
&gt; But of course nobody is perfect, and the folks I
&gt; have seen just this 
&gt; week have been exhausting. Yesterday a small degree
&gt; of that 
&gt; contagion did occur, and well into the evening I
&gt; felt their remnants 
&gt; of anguish and grief. I had a well-defined feeling
&gt; of needing to 
&gt; take a &quot;psychic shower.&quot; It finally passed when I
&gt; went to bed.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is this: Would those with more occult
&gt; experience than I 
&gt; recommend simply Qabalistic Cross, Lesser Banishing
&gt; Ritual of the 
&gt; Pentagram, and Middle Pillar Exercise, or is there
&gt; something more 
&gt; specific to cleansing worth trying?
&gt; 
&gt; I am reminded of a brief mention in IIH about
&gt; &quot;larvae,&quot; disincarnate 
&gt; thoughtforms created unwittingly by people suffering
&gt; great pain and 
&gt; disorganization, that &quot;stick&quot; to vulnerable
&gt; passersby. Or something 
&gt; like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments? Advice?
&gt; 
&gt; Warmest regards,
&gt; Pax Felix
&gt; 
&gt;
