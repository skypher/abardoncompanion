Dear David,

&gt; With Eight Temples, after the initial scripted meditations (the first 
&gt; eight months), is there any order one is supposed to explore the 
&gt; temples in, or can I just explore where I feel most drawn?

Explore! Explore! Explore!

Personally, I've been working on the Eight Temples meditation
for goodness knows how long and I still haven't gotten past the
Geburah temple yet because I have a rather strong inclincation
to explore mental constructs rather thoughally before heading
on.

Explore the four elemental realms of mulkuth. Cultivate you're
relationship with the four archangels. Walk through the archways
behind the mirrors that reflect your personality in yesod.
Wander around the Hod temple for hours on end, poking your head
into different rooms and talk with all of the spirits there. In
the Netzach temple play with the two dogs, talk to the
manifestations of Raphiel, wander around on the dark side of
Netzach, talk to the spirits that are acting and playing in the
fields, use the fountian as a scrying mirror. In tiphereth
explore the twelve areas of the city of gold, experiment
projecting you're consciousness into different aspects of the
temple. In particular, projecting your consciousness into the
center of the crystal and meditating upon stillness and mental
quietude can be quite profound. In the Geburah temple...poke
you're head around the curtians of the five elemental weapons.
Basically, go to those places where Rawn simply hasn't explained
all that much about.

Also, if you're dealing with a particular issue, you now have a
general idea of the different qualities that each of the various
sepheroth has and how that quality can manifest it's way down
into your life. The temples are tools to help you with your self
expression and self development. Use them as you see fit.

&gt; With the Self-Healing Archaeous: Is the hallmark of having adequately 
&gt; mastered Lesson One the ability to sense and totally relax all of the 
&gt; respective parts of the physical body? I can go through the 
&gt; meditation without following the audio lesson (which is good, because 
&gt; I've misplaced my CD) but I hold a lot of habitual, chronic tension 
&gt; which it will take some doing to release. I am guessing that it is 
&gt; better to stay with this until I have developed a deeper state of 
&gt; relaxation through dwelling on the physical body, is this correct or 
&gt; am I making too much of this particular lesson?

We all have to deal with chronic tension; it's a part of being
alive. The only time when we are truely relaxed and free of
tension is when we're dead. So, personally, my assesment would
be that if you can relax to a certian degree as well as keep
your attention spread throughout the four elemental regions all
at once, then you're ready to progress to lesson two.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
