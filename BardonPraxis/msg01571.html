Dear Horus, 

&gt;From my personal &amp; very limited experience of healing others, I 
always try to feel from the &quot;Higher Self&quot; Connection if I am allowed 
or not. If getting the &quot;Yes&quot;, I am going. This can go as far as 
breaking down person unconsciuous resistances, but mostly the person 
is herself the one who is leading the healing, I am just helping 
bringing energy.

&gt;&gt; and Is it alright to do this without her knowledge of it? 

But, before getting the &quot;Yes&quot;, there is a basic : does the person 
want to be healed through me ? Illness and Pain belongs to each one, 
there is no right granted for anyone to take anything away from 
somebody else experience. 
In your case, does your friend ask for your help ? If not, there is 
little to be done, her experience belongs to her. Using your 
abilities for healing her without her knowledge and consents will be 
no good, for herself and for you. 
But whatever her answer, you can still talk to her and speak about 
her. This will also question your true motivation for helping her. 

This is the theory, but in real life, to my opinion, things are 
clearly different if illness are part of your Life experience or if 
you simply get an headache from yesterday going outside cold &amp; rain 
without your umbrella. For the lattest, it is becoming just an energy 
issue.
&gt;From an intellectual standpoint, what you say about your friend 
clearly falls into the first category. 

Hope it helps, all the best

Pierre Mikael

&gt; I have a question for all of you, btw I think my introduction never 
got posted but, I am Male 28yrs old, Ive been praticing the Bardon 
books for well over six years now.. Im still not entirely masterd KTQ 
but I also go back and repractice many of the different sections of 
all the books from time to time.. My question is though, I have a 
friend of mine whom is a young female, she has had a very hard life, 
been abused and misstreated, and through such she has aquired a great 
many of Elemental and MENTAL Imballances.. She is a good soul in her 
heart, but she has huge problems in relating to the real world, and 
has no acceptable social skills, she also has a problem with telling 
lies to try and impress others.. I had a short affair with her which 
I hoped would last longer, as I can see her potential, but she felt 
something for me which scared her, so she decided to end the romantic 
part of the relationship.. My question is, do you have any 
suggestions as how I can effectively help cure
&gt; her of her Mental/elemental imballances using either KTQ or 
IIH?.. and Is it alright to do this without her knowledge of it? 
Thanks for all the input Ive really enjoyed all the comments thus far 
since Ive joined the group.
&gt; 
&gt; Blessings to ye all.
&gt; 
&gt; Lord Horus.
