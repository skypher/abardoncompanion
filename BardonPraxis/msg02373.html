I found this article online. I wondered is it would be of interest 
to any of the forum members.

THE F O G C LODGE

The Freemasonic Order of the Golden Centurium



By Dr. Adolf Hemberger



A purely magical-mystical loge was founded in 1840 in Munich by some 
German rich industrialists and well situated citizens. This lodge 
existed until 1933. At all times only 99 persons of the male gender 
could belong to this esoteric working-group or secret lodge. This 
lodge basically never appeared in the open.



This lodge had nothing to do with regular Freemasonry. They
didn't 
have any actual degrees, ranks and levels of realisation. The 
advancement to apprentice, journeyman and master was only of 
symbolic character. All secrets were given during the initiation. 
The other &quot;grades&quot; were not ranks, but only temple-stones
which were 
provided with a number and name. Their intention was demonological 
oriented i.e. they tried, in alliance with allegedly existing 
negative spiritual forces to obtain personal advantages, influence, 
power and money for their members. For this reason they placed 
themselves under mars-daimon &quot;Barzabel&quot;, the old bull-god
Astaroth, 
Belial and Asmodi as lodge-daimon who took place number 100 in the 
lodge.



Similar to the Russian Roulette (also practised by the order of 
assassins which also existed at the turn of the century (19th to the 
20th century) in Central Europe), every five years (if at that point 
of time no other lodge member had died) a balloting for &quot;death 
candidate&quot; took place on the evening (June 23rd) before
John's day. 
This death candidate served as &quot;lodge-sacrifice&quot; for the
services of 
the transcendental powers in which the lodge believed. The dead-
candidate was determined by the draw of a lot or a ballot. In the 
later case there were 98 white balls and 1 black ball in the ballot 
box. Whoever drew the dead-lot became, according to the constitution 
of the order, property of the supposed lodge daimon, i.e. he had to 
consume deadly poison during the lodge meeting.



The Grandmaster of this organisation that was part of a 
truly &quot;macabre&quot; and supersaturated society had the authority
to 
order the balloting three times if &quot;fate&quot; demanded him draw
the 
black ball. The fortune and capital of the &quot;sacrificed&quot;
member came 
into the treasury of the lodge. The lodge-seat, lodge-number and the 
serving imagospurius[1] were assigned to the new member who was to 
be initiated on the same day. Allegedly the lodge mastered in theory 
and practice almost all black-magical techniques. Every member was 
bound to the lodge-daimon by oaths, blood-rituals and mental-pacts. 
The most important rituals were taken from the works of ceremonial 
magic (see &quot;Heptameron&quot;, Waite: Ceremonial Magic, Stroessner-
Bachhausen: &quot;Freimaurerei und Magie&quot; etc.). Also
combat-telepathy 
and the ray-apparatus Tepaphone were used. (See Fraternitas Saturni 
and the Order of the Mentalic Builders).

Information about this lodge were given by Gregor A. Gregorius from 
mouth to ear to Master Ptahhotep of the Fraternitas Saturni, 
Wolther, Guido (Master Daniel), 33rd degree of the Fraternitas 
Saturni and it Grandmaster for a while, was also member do the Droit-
Humain order; descriptions of the rituals, techniques and procedures 
of the FOGC lodge.
