Subject: [BardonPraxis] Wealth and Esotericism
Date: Tue, 17 Feb 2004 08:30:36 EST</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Dear List,</pre><br>
<tt>One of the list members stated that he was still in the university and very<br>
career motivated; he was wondering if his drive for achieving big success 
would<br>
be an impediment to his spiritual progress.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>In short, he asked &quot;is there anything wrong with that (making 'BIG 
money')?&quot;</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Having had the opportunity to deal with people across the entire financial<br>
spectrum, from very poor to so wealthy they literally did not know what to 
do<br>
with it, I think there are several things anyone asking this question needs 
to<br>
consider.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>The current belief in material poverty as being good and wealth as being 
bad<br>
has its roots in several areas, one of which a form of gnosticism which 
says,<br>
material life is essentially evil and needs to be escaped from, thus throw<br>
yourself into your spiritual activities.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>The same is found in any schools of yoga, and is easily understood as a 
form<br>
of compensation in cultures and communities that suffer under crushing 
poverty<br>
or little avenues for material advancement.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Another influence is the Roman Church, that used similar language to 
comfort<br>
peasants (or keep them from rioting) for the last 1,000 years. With 
improved<br>
standards of living, courtesy the industrial and technological revolutions,<br>
this holds less power.</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">The Protestant Work Ethic that equates material success and wealth as a for
of godly blessing has also eroded it somewhat.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">So where does that leave us?</pre><br>
<tt>Well, if we look at Wealth and Esoteric Wisdom, we see they both relate to<br>
the qabalistic sphere of Chesed. Wealth it the more material manifestation 
of<br>
this force, wisdom its more subtle form.</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Chesed is in short, out inner blueprint or highest ideals in the realms of
duality, or manifestation.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Projected through Yesod, or our subconscious, they take form.</pre><br>
<tt>Now, lets look at the idea of renunciation in Easter and Western though. We<br>
hear a lot about it, giving once again the idea that only a monastic life 
is<br>
the spiritual life. However, there is the warning that it is easier to be 
a<br>
sinner while a hermit than in the world.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>In truth, renunciation is not an absence of material things, but in using<br>
them, not being used by them, and being firm in your commitment that the 
material<br>
life is a tool and not an end.</tt><br>
<br>
<blockquote style="border-left: #5555EE solid 0.2em; margin: 0em; padding-left: 0.85em"><tt>From this point of view, all things can be brought into the Path of 
</tt></blockquote><pre style="margin: 0em;">Service.</pre><br>
<tt>If our highest ideal is to be enlightened for ourselves alone, that puts us<br>
at Tiphareth. If our ideal is to make wealth for ourselves alone that puts 
us<br>
in Malkooth. If our ideal is to serve and be of assistance to humanity, 
that<br>
puts us in Chesed, where all things are at our disposal.</tt><br>
<br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">There is also the reality that you will die.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">Your time is limited, even if it is 100 or 150 years thanks to medical
science.</pre><br>
<pre style="margin: 0em;">As such it is not so much what you do, but why you do it. Time is limited,
pick wisely.</pre><br>
<tt>If it is out of need for security and to own nice things, for status, and<br>
privilege, you are working from fear. If it is to enjoy life while making 
firm<br>
and definite assistance to others, then it is our of love and compassion - 
the<br>
domain of Chesed - and you will not even be asking the question you did.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>I hope this makes your journey into the Magic Mirror a little more 
fruitful.</tt><br>
