<pre>Good morning;

As I practice the lessons of Franz Bardon I sometimes come across 
lessons by Rawn Clark. In my beginnings I found the Bardon lessons so 
inspiring and thoroughly infused with powerfully simple application 
that I wondered at using different techniques. Would it diffuse or 
lesson the importance to my inner self of the pure Bardon techniques? 

The question mostly arose in my particular circumstances because I 
came from a backgroun of Eastern mysticism training using the 
Chackras system. So I was accutely aware of not mixing two 
definitions, two systems but purifying and simplifying my inner 
workshop work by focusing only on the Bardon system.

In fact, I have found Rawn Clark's techniques and lessons nothing but 
affirming and additive to the clarification and application of Franz 
Bardon's lessons and techniques. This has been a pure joy for me to 
find and fealize and subsequently incorporate into my daily lessons 
and practices. 

The only point where I felt any kind of confusion was in charging my 
intake of food, water and air as per the Bardon step 1 techniques. I 
was sorely tempted after having learned the TMO-IHVH-ADNI exercises 
to use this super charged method of impressing positive volition on 
these items. But, instead I found that I had better stick with the 
Bardon methodology of charging the food, water and air by the shear 
power of my imagined will of calling and directing the positively 
impressed powers from the universe, as this was focusing and 
empowering a part of my mental/astral/physical body in its infancy 
which needed the focus to grow, as it was an integral part of my 
future magical body. 

The power of the TMO-IHVH-ADNI is simply too powerful of a charge in 
its accomplishment to not want to employ its useage in all things. 
That is such a good and positive comment of the power of that 
meditation and technique. But my self caution was to side step using 
it at this stage of my development (in this exercise only) to 
facilitate the natural growing of an integral part of my magical 
bodies to grow at a slower, firmer pace. 

I DO use TMO-IHVH-ADNI throughout my day for other positive 
impressioning of my volition and energies to excellent results. The 
practice alone is opening me up to infinite awarenesses that I had no 
idea were there before.

I use the Center of Stillness meditation daily. I am in contact with 
my web of personality and beginning work on it. This is such a 
healthy and balanced supplement to working on the positive/negative 
soul mirrors. The CSM also is an excellent and easy way for me to 
come into contact with my higher self, the Kether self and source of 
awareness. I expand with it every day.

I use the 8Temples meditation, mainly on the Malkuth 
meditation/ritual, for centering.

I use the Self Healing Archaeous for balancing help with my three 
bodies and the elements. 

All of these exercises done in conunction with each other help 
supplement in practical useage examples all of the qualities which 
the practitioner is developing using the Franz Bardon techniques. 

I'd just like to say a healthy; &quot;Thank you,&quot; to Rawn for all of his 
time, work and ethics involved in supplying these to we, the 
community to assist in our development. What a great good thing.

I Wish you All well,
Chuck
