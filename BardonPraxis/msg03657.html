&gt; Hello Jason,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been working on step one for about eight months, but only very 
&gt; seriously for about two months (i.e. close to an hour in the morn, an 
&gt; hour in the eve). I am experiencing massive life changes.
&gt; 
&gt; With regards to the eucharistic-based magics, at first I 
&gt; impregnated &quot;health&quot; into my wish. This seemed to have the effect of 
&gt; making me exercise more, heh heh. Because that wish was so abstract 
&gt; and because I was having trouble, at the time, creating IIH routines, 
&gt; I did breath/food/drink impregnations with the wish of succesfully 
&gt; managing IIH step one routines into my daily schedule. In two weeks 
&gt; I was doing my hour in the morning and a week later I had no trouble 
&gt; doing it in the evening, too. Wish completion in 3 weeks!
&gt; 
&gt; Events did alter in support of the change but if they hadn't I'm sure 
&gt; I would have changed my environment anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; I impregnated health into my girlfriend's soup recently and she went 
&gt; from a terrible cold to feeling much better in one day. So it seems 
&gt; to work on other people, but I'm not going to experiment too much 
&gt; with this right now. Consider that as minor anecdotal evidence. My 
&gt; girlfriend did not know that I'd impregnated the health wish into her 
&gt; soup.
&gt; 
&gt; To impregnate food I do this personal childhood magic thing where 
&gt; this guy in my head (yes, I know I sound crazy) loads the spell 
&gt; called Conscious Eating. I imagine this golden dust enters the food 
&gt; I'm about to eat. The guy in my head types out &quot;Kiyan wishes he will 
&gt; maintain and complete his IIH step one routines.&quot; The data flows 
&gt; into the dust that goes into the food. I imagine various scenes of 
&gt; me completing the thought control meditations, the stretching, the 
&gt; soul mirror, etc. that compromise Step One and imagine these scenes 
&gt; in the actual food. I do this for about a minute. Then I eat, 
&gt; thinking the whole time about my wish. Sometimes I'll segment my 
&gt; food to various components of my wish. That brocolli is 
&gt; stretching/exercising, that forkfull of noodles is thought 
&gt; discipline, etc. I actually don't reccomend segmenting food like 
&gt; this, I only do it as a crutch when I have a hard time visualizing 
&gt; all my wish into all my food.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, this is almost impossible to do this around other people, 
&gt; or if the radio is on, or if someone is talking to me. If I cannot 
&gt; escape company I try to cut my meal in half and eat half my meal 
&gt; magically and half my meal socially.
&gt; 
&gt; For this type of magic, I let my math/engineering mind stand to the 
&gt; side. I have faith, I do what feels right, I get results. I go from 
&gt; step A to C and then can presume that B is there even if I can't 
&gt; measure it with my ruler. So for me, the Akasha is there.
&gt; 
&gt; Gotta go, time for me to eat! :)
&gt; 
&gt; -- Kiyan
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was hoping other folks here would be willing to share their
&gt; &gt; experience of eucharistic-based character change: what was it 
&gt; like? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Did you wake up one morning and suddenly possess the quality that
&gt; &gt; you'd been working towards? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Did it come on gradually - perhaps with an occasional slide back - 
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; then fully integrate into your character? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Did you need to actively engage your will in the process, and 
&gt; perhaps
&gt; &gt; some auto-suggestion? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Did events, circumstances and &quot;things&quot; around you begin to alter 
&gt; too,
&gt; &gt; seemingly in support of your own change?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Someone here recently suggested that when the eucharistic magics 
&gt; work,
&gt; &gt; they do so because of a &quot;placebo&quot; effect. That is, if one
&gt; &gt; impregnates *someone else's* food/water/air with a thought, that
&gt; &gt; person gets no benefit. Inversely, it works only when one
&gt; &gt; *consciously* consumes the substance that's been impregnated *by
&gt; &gt; oneself*. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In other words, it only works if you *believe* in it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, Rawn is emphatic: we are impressing an idea upon the 
&gt; Akasha
&gt; &gt; resident in the substance, and it's *actually* altering our mental 
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; astral bodies.....whether we believe it or not.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Given that I (sadly) have no personal evidence to support that, I'm
&gt; &gt; curious to hear of others' discoveries.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thank you kindly,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jason Paris
