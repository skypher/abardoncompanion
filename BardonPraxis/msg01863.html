<pre>Today, I took some time reading a text I had just downloaded (&quot;the 
Rosicrucian Mysteries&quot; by Mr Max Heindel, 1919).

Co&#xEF;ncidentally (of course :-) a passage looked strangely related to 
Rawn's correspondence around step 2 / feeling concentration, 
particularly as far as the the need to discern between form and 
essential meaning was concerned.

Could anybody confirm that Mr Heindel makes reference to the *same 
thing* below ? 
 
Excerpt from the end of chapter II, &quot;the problem of life&quot; :

Quote
...
Similarly the man whose spiritual vision has been newly opened 
requires to be trained; in fact, he is in much greater need thereof 
than the babe and the blind man already mentioned. Denied that 
training, he would be like a new-born babe placed in a nursery where 
the
walls are lined with mirrors of different convex and concave 
curvatures, which would distort its own shape and the forms of its 
attendants. 
If allowed to grow up in such surroundings and unable to see the 
real shapes of itself and its nurses it would naturally believe that 
it saw many different and distorted shapes, when in reality the 
mirrors were responsible for the illusion. Were the persons 
concerned in such an experiment and the child taken out of the 
illusory surroundings, it would be incapable of recognizing them 
until the matter had been properly explained. 
There are similar dangers of illusion to those who have developed 
spiritual sight, until they have been trained to discount the 
refraction and view the LIFE which is permanent and stable, 
disregarding the FORM which is evanescent and changeable.

Many thanks.
