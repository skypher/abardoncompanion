<pre>Hi Martin,

In Feb/March 2003, A friend and I tried to track down the status of 
the book. We contacted the publisher and even the author. Here's the 
relative email trail. Perhaps you could contact the author and let us 
know if the plan still stands and how soon it will be re-printed.
Thanks in advance,
antiloop1111

Subject: Availability of a book 

Hello Kathy, 
I'm inquiring about the following book: 

Paths of Wisdom: The Magical Cabala in the Western Tradition 
(Llewellyn's High Magick Series)
by John Michael Greer 

o Paperback: 416 pages ; Dimensions (in inches): 1.25 x 9.25 x 
6.25 

o Publisher: Llewellyn Publications; (July 1996) 

o ASIN: 1567183158   


I've been searching high and low for Mr. Greer's book, Paths of 
Wisdom. All I've been able to determine is that a new copy was once 
available for $16.95 (US) and now all I can manage is a used copy for 
$69.99. I understand that it is no longer in print. I'd simply like 
to know: 1) if there are plans for a reprint at any point in the near 
future, and 2) if you know of a source where I might be able to get a 
new copy for a reasonable price now? From everything I've heard, 
it's a fantastic book. It's recommended above even Dion 
Fortune's &quot;Mystical Qabalah&quot; for clarity, understanding, and 
comprehensiveness. Thank-you...

Subject: Paths of Wisdom

Dear (Sir)

Thanks for your note. _Paths of Wisdom_ has been out of print for just
over a year now, and I know a lot of people have been trying to get
copies. I wish I had a private stash to sell, but no such luck. The
rights will revert to me in February of 2004. I've already discussed a
reprint with another publisher, and once I get the rights back it 
should be available pretty quickly, but there's that unavoidable 
delay!

I plan on expanding the book a little, putting in material on aspects 
of Cabalistic theory and practice that were over my head in 1994-5 
(when the original was written). So I hope it will be worth the wait.

Best,

John Michael Greer

&gt; Dear all,
&gt; 
&gt; I am currently trying to get hold of a copy of a book mentioned in 
&gt; Rawn's annotated bibliography (on his website) called 'Paths of 
&gt; Wisdom: The Magical Cabala in the Western Tradition' (Llewellyn's 
&gt; High Magick Series) by John Michael Greer.
&gt; 
&gt; I was surprised to find that, despite it being published in 1996, I 
&gt; could not find it anywhere on the internet (Amazon, Abebooks, 
Barnes 
&gt; and Noble etc), the only couple of used copies I did come across 
&gt; were priced between $100-250! Amazon.co.uk does list the book, but 
&gt; as currently not available. They used to sell it for &#xA3;14.99
though, 
&gt; which is more in my price range!
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone knows of anywhere I can find it, I'd be grateful.
&gt; 
&gt; Rawn, I'm assuming you bought your copy nearer to the time it was 
&gt; first published when it was more readily available?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I am reading 'The Complete Guide to the Kabbalah' by Will 
&gt; Parfitt (yes, Rawn, I have made sure I have had time for meditation 
&gt; as well ;-)) - has anyone else read this book? It is my very first 
&gt; plunge into the subject and I was wondering how reliable the book 
&gt; is. I'd appreciate any comments from anyone who has read the book 
&gt; and who has something else to compare it to :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a lot,
&gt; 
&gt; Martin
