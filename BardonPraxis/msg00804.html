<pre>Dear Rawn,

&gt;&gt;&gt;This is true but only in a specific way. Namely, physical posture,
etc., affects the *astral* body or emotional state. Causality does run
both ways in regard to the physical and astral bodies, but this is not
true, strictly speaking, between the physical and mental bodies. It
does not *directly* affect the mental body. This is important to the
magician who must be master of their own emotional state. In other
words, the magician must be able to determine their mental state
regardless of their physical or emotional states. For example, some of
my best thinking is done slouched in my chair! ;-)&lt;&lt;&lt;

When writing up my last post to you, I somehow had the feeling that 
you where going to say something like that. And I was going to adress 
such a sentiment that you might have potentially expressed before you 
even posted, but something held me back for some reason. Though at 
the moment I don't seem to recall exactly what I was going to say. LOL

Essentially my point was that, in some way, shape or form, causality 
does run both ways, even if it is in a roundabout way. Though, saying 
that physical body can have an effect upon the mental body through 
the medium of the astral body seems awfully similar to saying that 
the mental body can have an effect upon the physical body through the 
medium of the astral body. From what I understand of the theory of 
the three bodies, neither the mental nor the physical bodies can by 
pass the astral body in order to effect each other directly. While 
there may be a certian hierachy between the mental, astral, and 
physical bodies...it would appear to be a hierachy of, more or less, 
equals.

Getting back to the original topic of percieving essential meaning, I 
worked through a rather lengthy meditation to see if I could figure 
out what all this fuss about essential meaning is about. As a whole 
the meditaiton lasted for the better porition of a number of hours. 
Essentially, I just started out working with one pointedness durring 
work, trying to quiet the mind as much as possible. You know, get rid 
of all that verbal chatter that goes on inside one's head. Eventually 
I managed to get into a state that could be classified as a rather 
deep state of vacancy of mind which I maintained for quite some time. 
When I looked at a broom, percieved it, it was like a rush of 
information was rushing at me. Almost like I had always had a vision 
problem and suddenly a set of proper perscription glasses and was 
seeing things clearly for the first time. It was like an epiphany, 
and &quot;ah ha&quot; experience. The left brain, which is primarily language 
and logic bound, would not have been able to handle this bandwith, 
working within a certian sort of Aristotilean syllogism. Route 
processing if you will. Whereas the right brain looks at the whole, 
the gestalt...which I seemed to be perceiving. Something that seems 
quite akin to what you keep on calling essential meaning.

I also took this gestalt of a broom, and other things that I 
percieved and was able to make some rather clear images of them with 
my imagination. It was odd, and rather clear. I also turned my 
perception to a page in a book that I had recently read and recalled 
it almost perfectly. With further experimentation, this could prove 
to be quite a usefull in the future.

Comments, questions, ideas are more than welcome.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
