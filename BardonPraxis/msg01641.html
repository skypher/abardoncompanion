&gt; What I got out of zen was some kind of total defiance/disrespect 
&gt; towards current reality. Zen became a &quot;game&quot; destroyer! As you 
&gt; wrote, zen says its illusion, all of it. 

It's almost disappointing, when being told that all possible 
delights and interests in worldly things are simply illusions to be 
avoided, or more accurately, *transcended*. That can certainly seem 
like a &quot;game destroyer&quot; as you say, and the fact that I'm 
disappointed probably speaks volumes about my *own* degree of 
ripeness (or lack thereof ;)). Perhaps the &quot;Direct Path&quot; (bypassing 
magical development) to conscious union with Divinity is for the 
few, ripe-enough seekers ready to renounce the &quot;maya&quot; of the world, 
and devote their life to the ultimate goal of Divine Union. 

I guess it all depends on how you look at it, to be cliche.

To use Mouni Sadhu again as an example, it was through his works 
that I was turned on to the works of Sri Maharshi. And it was 
through Draja Mickaharic and his book &quot;Practice of Magic&quot; that I was 
turned on to Sadhu. &quot;Concentration&quot; is recommended by Mickaharic 
for concentration and visualization exercises, to be the foundation 
of future magical work. It's ironic though, because 
in &quot;Concentration,&quot; Sadhu tries to steer the participant as far away 
from &quot;occult&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;-related use of the &quot;newly-won&quot; powers 
derived from the exercises, and to the ultimate goal of Samadhi. If 
not confusing, I felt especially guilty after attempting some of the 
exercises. The second I start to indulge my interest in magic- 
*BAM*... Sadhu is in the back of my head going, *tssk tsssk 
tskkk*. ;) 

&gt; all being illusion can be 
&gt; a very seductive noose if taken as a life-path. 

I agree, and think that perhaps a more balanced development via a 
system like Bardon's would eliminate that problem. That's not to 
say that those ripe enough to follow a more Zen-like path shouldn't 
do it. I guess people have different callings. 

&gt; 
&gt; ...cuz some will use zen as an excuse for disassociation, rather 
&gt;than go out in the world and use zen on the problems they face. 
&gt;This is the danger I see, anyway.

Without the soul mirror work especially of IIH, I can totally see 
the potential for disassociation, and zen becomes an excuse for any 
kind of antisocial behavior. How is one to know that these 
tendencies could be buried within them without the soul mirror work 
in the first place?!

Best-
Devin
