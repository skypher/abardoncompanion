<pre>Dear Friends,

Yesterday I received an excellent set of questions from a personal
correspondent as part of an ongoing discussion of &quot;essential meaning&quot;.
I replied and asked if he'd mind my forwarding it to BardonPraxis.
Since he's already a member of BardonPraxis and all around good guy, he
said sure. :) So here it is:
==========================================

Dear Conn,

Essential meaning can be *symbolized* through words but it can never be
completely expressed with them. It's a pre-cognitive experience and the
putting into words bit, comes after perception. It's not a part of the
perception itself.

What that means is that I can't tell from your words, if you're
describing a direct perception of essential meaning or only the
words/thoughts/ideas that follow from it.

When you perceive the essential meaning of a thing, like a rock, apple
or person, it's a flood of all sorts of information. It's not just what
you think about it or feel about it, yet the information you perceive
*contains* how you think and feel about it. In other words, you
perceive the whole of the thing. You perceive its &quot;purpose&quot;, the
imprint of everything it's been through and its &quot;personality&quot;, all at
once. It's so much information, that your brain can't comprehend it
until you begin putting words/thoughts to it. But you don't want to
begin putting words/thoughts to it too soon as this can interfere with
*direct* perception. Instead, you want to savor it for a bit first. :)

I don't remember whether you've been working with the Archaeous audio
lessons or not? If not, I recommend that you do because Lesson Three
gives a sound method for experiencing essential meaning and integrating
it into the words/thoughts level of your mind.

The basic process/technique is to begin with a one-pointed meditation
upon your apple, for example. When your one-pointedness feels complete,
go *directly* into an emptiness of mind. It's within the
non-thinking/speaking emptiness that you find the perception of
essential meaning. Spend whatever amount of time in the emptiness as
seems appropriate and then return *directly* to a one-pointed meditation
on your apple.

When you enter into an emptiness from a one-pointedness, you are, in
effect, seeding the emptiness with your one-pointedness. The emptiness
thus seeded, will pertain to the focus you brought to it and within the
emptiness you will perceive *essential* information about your previous
point of focus. This, of course, occurs without form (i.e.,
thoughts/words/idea) and until you get comfortable with this level of
non-word/thought perception (sort of like letting your eyes adjust to
darkness), it's most likely that you won't be conscious of perceiving.

When you return from this seeded emptiness, to your original point of
focus, you are, in effect, bringing the direct perceptions of essential
meaning, back with you, into the realm of thoughts/idea/words. They
will naturally accrue form and you will then be able to recognize them
as new thoughts/ideas/words that pervade your one-pointedness. These
will be ideas and thoughts that weren't present during the
one-pointedness meditation which preceded your entry into the emptiness.

In Lesson Three of the Archaeous, it's a bit more complex AND complete
than what I've just outlined, but those are the bare bones of the
technique. In the Archaeous, you consciously descend from the Air
region of your mental body, wherein you engaged in your one-pointedness
meditations (the Fire region was the emptiness), and bring those
ideas/thoughts down into the Water region of your mental body. This is
the awareness of your entire astral body, so this re-contextualizes your
direct perceptions in the language of emotional significance, adding yet
another layer of integration to your understanding of the essential
meaning. Then you consciously descend into the Earth region of your
mental body (i.e., the awareness of your physical body) bringing the
essential meaning, clothed with thoughts and emotional significance,
into the realm of your mundane awareness (i.e., your brain-bound
consciousness).

So, if you haven't taken it up already, then I suggest the Archaeous.
This is a way for you to experience it first-hand. Well hell, what did
you expect? *I* can't resist inserting at least one &quot;find out yourself&quot;
statement! ;-)

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark

&gt; Hi Rawn,
&gt;
&gt; Due to the time lag between stupid and intelligent
&gt; thoughts arising within my mind, the issue of
&gt; essential meaning resurfaced. I think I'm on the right
&gt; track, but I wanted a little verification from
&gt; yourself, so I can get this right once and for all :)
&gt;
&gt; Instead of describing the essential meaning in
&gt; different terms, I'll try and give a practical example
&gt; of the essential meaning of a few &quot;objects&quot;. OK?
&gt;
&gt; 1. An apple.
&gt; ------------
&gt;
&gt; First of all, the physical/astral significance could
&gt; be conveyed through describing it in all the terms one
&gt; should expect to describe a physical apple, ok? For
&gt; example, it's green (or red), tastes like an apple
&gt; (slightly acidic, and sweet). Then personal
&gt; significance is purely astral, memories of picking
&gt; apples from childhood, for example. Everything ok
&gt; so-far? :)
&gt;
&gt; The essential meaning: a means for sustinance,
&gt; symbolizes the offspring of the tree which bore this
&gt; fruit. Are they valid examples of essential meaning?
&gt;
&gt; 2. A rock
&gt; ---------
&gt;
&gt; Physical/Astral: Describing it's form and colour as
&gt; usual, what your physical eyes percieve and how any
&gt; normal person would describe a rock.
&gt;
&gt; Pure Astral: perhaps some resentment if you ever fell
&gt; off your bike and got a nasty scrape, because you
&gt; tried to use a rock on the road as a ramp, when you
&gt; were a kid? :)
&gt;
&gt; Essential Meaning (mental): symbolizes stability,
&gt; endurance, lasting over time.
&gt;
&gt; 3. A person
&gt; -----------
&gt;
&gt; Physical/Astral: you describe their physical features,
&gt; weight, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Pure Astral: how they make you feel when you're in
&gt; their presence, all the various nuances which are
&gt; unexplainable, the feelings they elicit within you.
&gt;
&gt; Essential Meaning: As an individual human being, they
&gt; represent the macrocosm in their own microcosm (mind,
&gt; body, spirit).
&gt;
&gt; --
&gt;
&gt; Three examples should be enough, if I'm wrong you have
&gt; less to correct :) I realise these aren't very well
&gt; thought-out examples, but am I on the right track at
&gt; all, with essential meaning? I'm sorry to repeatedly
&gt; come back to you for advice; you're obviously blue in
&gt; the face from regurgitating the ususal &quot;find out
&gt; yourself&quot; statements :)
&gt;
&gt; One final question.. will essential meaning always be
&gt; capable of being expressed in a linguistic sense?
&gt; Essential meaning seems independant of &quot;brain-bound
&gt; consciousness&quot;, as you call it, and most of our brains
&gt; are &quot;wired&quot; to percieve everything in terms of our
&gt; language. I assume that essential meaning and other
&gt; mental development removes this limitation; but when
&gt; it comes to expressing this wisdom to others, like
&gt; now, is it *always* effective to retranslate back into
&gt; words? I hope I'm making sense!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks as always,
&gt; Conn
&gt;
&gt; PS My apologies, I'll start posting in your
&gt; brand-spanking new BardonPraxis (and on topic as
&gt; well!) as soon as I write up my little intro :)
