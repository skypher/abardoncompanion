<pre>Dear Rawn,

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's the difference between acting upon the universe and acting 
*as* the universe.&lt;&lt;&lt;

That sounds about right. The conundrum about this all is: by acting 
upon the universe, is one not working as a part of the universe? The 
trick is to be able to encompass the whole universe and act in such a 
manner.

&gt;&gt;&gt;'Vav' is attributed to Alchemy (Bardon's 5th book) and the 
Archaeous is patterned after an Alchemical process. Also, through the 
Archaeous, I wish to instill the experiential Understanding of the 
three bodies and their inter-relationship, and I use the Quadrapolar 
Magnet to provide structure to that experience.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Intuitivly, when I started working with the Letter F I began to have 
the distinct feeling that I had done some sort work with an aspect of 
this Letter before. In particular, the work of the Archeaous. Yet 
intellectually, it didn't make any sense due to the fact that you had 
previously stated that the work of the Archeaous delt with Bardon's 
fourth book _The Golden Book of Wisdom_ which would be the Emperor 
and the Letter H. Yet at the same time, when working with the Letter 
H I didn't get that same sort of feeling.

After a hard day at work today I decided to try a something a bit 
new. I transfered my consciousness to my depth point, and then 
through into the akasha after becoming aware of my three bodies. I 
then uttered the Letter F a number of times mentally with the 
intent/legality that it would balance out the three bodies in a 
similar manner to the working within the Archeaous along with a shape 
and time of action. Almost instantaniously after I pronounced the 
Letter all of the three bodies snapped back into harmony like a 
couple of soldiers to attention.

The work of learning the Letters seems to be sheading new ligh tupon 
the 32 Paths of Wisdom document. I guess it is one of those things 
that only makes sense after personal experience with these qualities.

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist

&gt; Dear Peter,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Yet, at the same time, I'm pretty sure it is not just a matter of
&gt; MORE POWER! :) &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; It's the difference between acting upon the universe and acting 
*as* the
&gt; universe.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; While I may be shooting from the hip, I get the distinct feeling 
that
&gt; the Archeous seems to express the qualities of the Letters &quot;F&quot; 
and &quot;C&quot;.
&gt; &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; :) Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;F&quot; in the sense that it is an expression of the quadrapolar 
magnet
&gt; within each of the three bodies. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Bardon's &quot;F&quot; is the Hebrew 'Vav' (The Hierophant), the 5th Path --
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;The fifth path is called the Root consciousness because it is the
&gt; substance of the Unity, joining itself to that Understanding which
&gt; itself emanates from Primordial Wisdom.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; The corresponding Torah verse reads, &quot;And Elohim divided the light 
from
&gt; the darkness.&quot;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;C&quot; in the sense that one is impreginating Divine ideas in the 
form
&gt; of the four elements within their respective regions in the three
&gt; bodies. This work with the Letter &quot;C&quot; seems more apparent when one 
is
&gt; working with the impregination of the structure of the Tree of Life
&gt; within the three bodies. An expression of a higher expression of the
&gt; magic of the Eucharist, an impregination of the highest divine 
virtues
&gt; within a form. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Bardon's &quot;C&quot; is the Hebrew 'Tzaddi' (The Star), the 29th Path --
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;The twenty-ninth path is called the Corporeal consciousness 
because it
&gt; marks out the forms and reproduction of all bodies which are
&gt; incorporated under every cycle of the heavens.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; The corresponding Torah verse reads, &quot;And Elohim blessed them.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
