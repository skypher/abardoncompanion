<pre>I don't see karma as being designed to provide lessons for individuals. One 
might compare it to electricity. Is electricity designed to teach us not to put 
a nail in the light socket? However, one may learn that that is not the correct 
thing to do. I look upon karma as being neutral. It doesn't care what you do. 
If you plant carrot seed, you will get carrots. Does that have anything to do 
with karma? It has more to do with the law of cause and effect.

I once asked my brother what he learned from a certain experience he had. His 
reply was, &quot;I learned not to do that again.&quot; What a profound answer!! If that 
is all we learn, that would be sufficient. No reason to delve into the why's 
and wherefor's. But our human plight seems to be making the same mistakes over 
and over again, right into the grave.

Someone once said, &quot;If I don't change, I will remain the same&quot;. I have a simple 
remedy for disease. It's change. Change your job, your spouse, where you live, 
your religion, the way you think. Everything. The problem is nobody wants to 
change, especially their self image. So instead of looking on the inside for 
answers to our problems, we go outside. That's the path of least resistence. 
The best that that can do is provide a temporary fix until one is willing to 
change.

Most healers that I see are running &quot;fix it&quot; shops. The patient says, &quot;Fix me 
up, doc, so I can do the same things that made me sick in the first place.&quot; Of 
course, most &quot;good&quot; docs will do just that. Although I once knew a chiropractor 
that would not accept patients that drank cow's milk. He maintained that cow's 
milk was for the calf and mother nature knows best. How far we have fallen from 
that concept!!

Just had a chance to read some back log of e-mails and was delighted to find 
all this stimulating discussion. I am also a level 6 pranic healer (all that 
means is that I have taken practical lessons in some advance techniques) from 
M.Choa Kok Sui, and there, it was highly recommended to learn Bardonian 
Hermetics. :):)
As for the charging money or not, it becomes a personal decision which should 
not be justified. In my case, I used not to accept any compensation for the 
healings, later on I understood the importance of keeping the energy flowing 
(and with money is not different), then, whenever a patient offered to pay I 
accepted, kept some and gave some, worked quite well. 
In the area of karmic consequences, I learned quite a lot form Rawn &quot;However, 
from a perspective of Universal Legality, illness is a gift that is meant to 
teach us an Important karmic lesson that we have not been able to learn in the 
absence of disease.&quot; Thanks for this lines Rawn. I have a question for you on 
this area. I used to go to weekly pranic healing at a children's burned center 
unit. It was very difficult -and still is- to comprehend the karmic implication 
of a 4 month baby with severe burns in his body..

Dear David,

&gt;&gt; But what about &quot;emergency healing&quot;? Broken bones, slit wrists, 
burns, acute chemical or radiation poisoning. Addressing symptoms 
certainly is necessary at some levels. &lt;&lt;

Yes, of course. :)

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
