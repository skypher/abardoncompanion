Hello to everyone and I bow deeply:

I'd like to ask a general question. My experience with magic has been 'all 
Bardon' so far, but there is one question he seems to leave untouched and that 
is love between people, marriage and so forth. I have been giving this 
subject alot of thought as part of my step 1 mirror work, but as an incurable 
reader I thought I might get some more input.

I stumbled across Dion Fortune's 'Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage', 
which is pure theory, and have seen several recommendations towards another 
author by the name of Samael Aun Weor, and a book of his entitled 'The 
Perfect Matrimony'. I enjoyed the Fortune book and it did explain the levels of 
existence very clearly; its thesis is that a true and perfect marriage is that 
between people who complement each other on multiple levels, up to the highest 
point of consciousness each has reached, so that they can continue their 
journeys together. There are many other points of theory too, and some things 
which at 1st sight are a bit objectionable - gay relationships are rejected out 
of hand as misguided, for example. 

This book also states point blank that working with a partner is a safer 
surer and more natural path than working alone. This idea resonates strongly 
with me as correct given my (so far limited) experiences and I would like to 
know what is the reaction of the BardonPraxis members to it!

The book by Weor, on the other hand, I haven't read. Judging by Amazon 
reviews it divides people - the majority fervently and ecstatically (but for my 
tastes far too stridently) in favour, and a small minority dead set against.

I'd be grateful if anyone could give me any knowledge of these ideas and 
books, and of how they fit into Bardon's practice. As far as love and sex are 
concerned, Rawn says that sex is important and natural etc., but not much more. 
Bardon, meanwhile, mentions sexual mysteries which because of the current 
state of mankind he is unable to divulge.

I would like to know if anyone can tell me whether for a confirmed, 
planning-to-be-lifelong Bardonist, such avenues are in their opinion worth 
pursuing. 
I will say this: I've always been very much a romantic and convinced that on 
some level love in the sense everyone knows and discusses it is far more 
intimately linked to the eternal than is normally said. In other words I'm 
starving for some input here, although my introspective activities have given 
me 
alot of clues. Anyone knowledgeable who has read these two authors would really 
help me if they could offer their opinions on them, and the experiences and 
reasonings behind what they think.

Also if anyone can help me with the following questions (and someone can I 
know!), I would be immensely grateful: Fortune mentions seven levels of being, 
from divine spark down to physical. These appear to be the same as the levels 
Moryason speaks of in his notes on IIH, which confused me when I first read 
them as they weren't mentioned by Bardon himself. My questions are:

1) Are these levels best understood in the *Hermetic* sense as finer 
*gradings* of the basic 'split' - mental/astral/physical?
2) Do all four elements operate at all the levels?
3) I know nothing about kabbalistic matters yet, but is there a relationship 
between these levels and the kingdoms of the kabbalah?
4) Similarly, having read (but being nowhere near practicing) PME, is there 
a relationship between those levels and the planetary spheres of evocation?

I am not planning to do any monkeying with any stuff I shouldn't, I'm just 
trying to understand. My experience with the mirror so far has taught me one 
basic truth: love is the point! Thanks in advance for any and all help!

Best wishes, love, and respect to all - Jason
