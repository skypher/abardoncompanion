<pre>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Karl Peck and I have had 
some training in the Arts Magick. Having once been a member of an 
order (based on the GD tradition), and now, I'm a solitary worker. I 
mostly lurk on the FranzBardonMagi list, rarely posting.

In answer to the question. Would you consider it acceptable to 
practice for an hour once/day instead of twice? 

I personally only do &#xBD; hour Bardon Practice each day, (more if there 
is opportunity which is rare) still only on step 1 after 6 months, 
but what's the rush, better to do it slowly and right, that have to 
do the work twice. This isn't due to laziness, but to other 
commitments on my time. I have seen results of my work, and know it 
is worth continuing.

IMO doing some everyday regularly (even if it is only &#xBD; hour) is 
better than missing days and having an irregular practice.

Karl

&gt; Thanks for the reply! the &quot;Self-Healing Archaeous&quot; seems a very

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regardless of what the Merkur editor suggests, these four items 
&gt; were NOT
&gt; &gt; meant to be (sequential) requirements. They were only 
suggestions,
&gt; &gt; meant to spur your own imagination.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; It seems very easy to read too deeply into IIH exercises and over 
&gt; complicate them; I think it would be a usefull practice if 
&gt; individuals upon completing each step (esp. the early ones) wrote a 
&gt; list of problems they had to overcome and the solutions they found. 
&gt; This would allow ppl still stuck on the step to gain a wider 
&gt; perspective, and maybe gain some confidence and insight. Any1 want 
to 
&gt; comment on this idea?
&gt; 
&gt; Seeing as my last questions gained me such usefull answers, i'd 
like 
&gt; to pose another 2 if you'll indulge me :)
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In the one-pointedness exercise is it recomended to stick with 
one 
&gt; subject from session to session, or to pick a different one each 
&gt; time? I found it easier to use some than others, but I wonder if 
just 
&gt; picking subjects i'm drawn to will make later excersises more 
&gt; difficult? Also in this exercise, is it satisfactory to retain a 
&gt; single thought for 10 minutes if other thoughts are dimly 
experienced 
&gt; from time to time (though you do not lose the focussed on thought). 
I 
&gt; mean if a car goes by and makes a noise, I may not get an image of 
a 
&gt; car or any strong reaction, but a small part of my focus will 
briefly 
&gt; `look` in that direction if you know what i'm saying!? Is this a 
&gt; digression? How perfect does the exercise at this level have to be?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) This year i'm likely to be swamped with study. Would you 
consider 
&gt; it acceptable to practice for an hour once/day instead of twice? Am 
I 
&gt; likely to make progress in this manner? ... some days i'll be able 
to 
&gt; practice more, but uni has to come first this year.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the suggestions,
&gt; Joe.
