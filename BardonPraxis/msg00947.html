<pre>Dear Peter,

&gt;&gt; Allright, upon doing a little bit of meditation upon the card I can
definetly see how the symbolism upon it relates to Jewish Kaballah in
the Sepher Yetzirah. The IHVH in the center relates to the three
mothers, the seven planentary symbols relates to the seven doubles
and the zodiac symbols the twelve rinds. However, I am not quite sure
how the colour symbolism relates to the letters that Bardon gives
within the text. All well, no matter. I guess this is one of those
things that only a step eight initiate can truely understand. &lt;&lt;

;-) I doesn't take a Step 8'er to realize that there's absolutely no
relationship between these colors and the colors of the Letters (Fire
pole) given in KTQ.

Sorry to have been so uninformative in my first reply, but mainly I
wanted to prompt you into meditating on the symbol first. Now that you
have, here's a bit more to meditate about. ;-)

#1) The &quot;circles&quot; are actually wheels. I suggest that you print out 4
copies. One copy, leave as is. The second copy, cut out the wheel of
the zodiac. The third copy, cut out the wheel of the planets. And the
fourth copy, cut out the central circle. Now layer the wheels and
connect them together at their center points so that you can rotate the
various wheels in relation to each other.

#2) The outer wheel represents the Akashic essential meaning or
&quot;legality&quot; (Earth pole) as expressed through the 10 Sephirot and the
numbers 1 thru 10. The zodiacal wheel represents those Letters that
have a special affinity for the mental realm. The planetary wheel
represents those Letters that have a special affinity for the astral
realm (the &quot;seven portals to the soul&quot;). The inner square of the
Elements represents the physical realm.

#3) The reason Bardon said that this glyph especially represents the
Four-Letter Key is because it shows affinities, *through its color
symbolism*, between the four realms into which one will place the four
Letters.

This is difficult to explain with typed words! If we were talking
face-to-face, it wouldn't be a problem, but I'll give it a try anyway
and see what comes of it.

The place one starts is with the legality (i.e., the essential meaning)
of the physical effect one wishes to create. The Letter which
corresponds with that legality is placed in the Akasha. Thus you find
the appropriate Sephirot key on the outer wheel and turn it so that it's
at top. This represents the Letter you will place into the Akasha.

To then find the most harmonious combination of Letters to put into the
mental, astral and physical realms, you turn the inner wheels so that
the colors match with the color of your legality. Of course, this
assumes that you know all of the aspects of each Letter VERY thoroughly,
because it's not always a straight-forward and logical process. It's an
Art, so to speak.

Nonetheless, if you take the three charts I present in my &quot;Commentary
Upon KTQ&quot; and start fiddling around with your wheel, you'll either get
it or drive yourself insane. ;-)

This wheel is VERY versatile. You can really start anywhere (i.e., with
any realm) and dial up harmonious solutions to the other realms. For
example, if you desire a specific astral effect, you would start there
and then tune in your legality, then figure out your most harmonious
mental Letter, etc.

If you're working with just the single-Letter key, then from this glyph
you can get an idea of it's ultimate mental, astral and physical
effectiveness by way of harmonious color symbolism.

This wheel will also reveal certain conflicts and affinities between the
Letters.

But again, this only begins to *really* work when you know the Letters
inside and out. Up until that point, it can be a painstaking process to
make much sense of it, let alone any actual use of it.

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
