<pre>Dear All,

This Meditation came to me under the influence of inspiration given by
David Coleman, whose great articles on astrology are presented on his
website www.astralvisions.de and under the influence of infinitely
Beautiful and to the same extent powerful techniques of working with
yourself described in TMO presented at www.tmo-wg.net.

The technique itself is nothing extraordinary &#x2013; in its simple form it
can be performed by anyone, but to experience it in its fullness, a good
perception of different levels of self is required. I can expect that
I&#x2019;m not the first to write down such a technique, so there is a
possibility, that some of you would know a similar way to open your
heart :)

When I performed this meditation for the first time, the abundance of
impressions it gave, brought me to tears. Now, after some time, when I
can put all of this into words, I want to share this meditation which
attunes you to the Universal Harmony, uncovers us in the face of
Universal Beauty and deeply cleanses us filling our being with Universal
Love&#x2026; 

Even if some of you won&#x2019;t like it, it can still become an inspiration
for some techniques you would devise for yourselves &#x2013; in the end, all
true magic is spontaneous :)

Blessed be,
Aleksander

-------------------------------------------
Meditation of an Open Heart

I suggest doing this meditation outdoors, standing barefoot on the
ground/grass. It can also be done sitting or lying down if you prefer.
Eyes should be open at the beginning. 

Take a few deep breaths and through all the meditation try to breathe
quite deeply, though calmly and steadily. 

Take a look around&#x2026;

Look at the nature that surrounds you&#x2026;

See every detail you have in front of your eyes&#x2026;

When breathing, feel the mix of fragrances that surrounds you&#x2026;

Feel the gusts of wind and sunlight on your face. If it&#x2019;s nighttime,
then observe the moonlight; if it&#x2019;s raining, then observe the water
drops falling on you; if there are thunders around you, then observe the
storm and the air changing with the exploding electrical charges, etc.

Hear all the sounds that surround you in that moment. Listen them very
carefully. 

Merge all those impressions into one overall perception. EXPERIENCE the
present moment. Be its conscious part. 

Now, having all those images, sounds, fragrances and feelings in front
of you, feel that you are also observed. Each and every tree you are
looking at is looking back at you. Each and every flower you smell is
smelling you. Think that all those things you see in front of you, are
aware. The grass you&#x2019;re standing on feels your feet and it delights the
contact with you the same way you feel the pleasure from feeling its
touch. 

If you want, you can reach to the whole Universe in your mind to observe
and enjoy the fact, that the tiniest part of this Universe is aware and
observes you while you observe it. 

Feel the Beauty and Harmony that surround you. 

Take your time concentrating on all of this&#x2026;

Now open you heart. 

Imagine that you tear apart all the shells of egoism, fear, tension and
negativity surrounding your heart. Let it fall down on the Earth which
will absorb them. Let your heart be naked towards your surroundings and
the whole Universe, just as they are naked towards you. 

Now with each breath inhale Beauty, Harmony and Love to your heart[1]
and with each exhale emanate[2] the same from your heart. Let those
three virtues fill your whole Being. Let your breath be connected to the
breath of the Universe. Feel that you, your surroundings and whole
Universe are One. 

If you can[3], raise your awareness to your Tiphareth and feel the
Beauty, Harmony and Love filing your Tiphareth and all your
incarnations. Then raise your awareness to your Binah and feel the
Beauty, Harmony and Love filling whole Binah, all its Individual selves
and all the incarnations &#x2013; present, past and future ones. Raise your
awareness to Chokmah and feel the Beauty, Harmony and Love filling all
Chokmah and all that existed, now exists and will exist in the Universe.
Raise your awareness to Kether and feel the Beauty, Harmony and Love
filling The ALL. 

Remain in this state until you feel that you are completely filled with
Beauty, Harmony and Love. 

Then return to your normal awareness, say a prayer of thanks for the
blessing you experienced and emanate the Beauty, Harmony and Love during
normal daily routines.

May we all be so blessed!

Footnotes:

[1] What is meant here is not breathing with the heart organ, but it&#x2019;s
visualizing the flow of Harmony, Beauty and Love into your whole body
through the heart. You can use here the pore breathing technique if you
know it. 

[2] This does not involve exhaling those virtues, but rather emanating
with what you already have of them In your heart. 

[3] It&#x2019;s an advanced technique of Magic of IHVH-ADNI described in &#x201E;TMO
Final Form&#x201D; article.
