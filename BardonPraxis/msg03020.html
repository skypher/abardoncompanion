<pre>The pillar of silence is a caution against bragging about what you are able to 
do to other people as that would be distracting to you and could generate ill 
will or misguided reverence from them. It's not referring to telling other 
people about hermetics, which is perfectly acceptable to do.

Subject: [BardonPraxis] Strange...


&gt;From where I sit the Step 1 work with soul mirrors is outstanding. In fact 
the whole of Step 1 is wonderful. I began by thinking I couldn't wait to 
accumulate a few elements, meet a sylph or two, and do some cool mental 
travelling 
- but this is better than any of that. It is life-changing. It is wonderful. 
As I go through it I keep thinking, I wish I could tell other people how to 
do this. I know we have to keep silent but it seems to me that the technique 
is a very valid alternative to all the me-me-meness, the endless therapy 
schools, the moral vapidity that people are subjected to. Simply exercise, have 
a 
cold shower, observe your thoughts, and write down your worst and best 
characteristics. It's... like magic! It offers perspective, I feel like I'm 
breathing for the first time in a long time to have everything just where I can 
see 
it. It's calisthenic, you do it, you put effort in and out pops reward.

One of my (Lesser) negative traits is my blabbering mouth. I want to tell 
everyone what is happening but I don't necessarily think it's such a good idea. 
All I'm saying is, I wish everyone could do this. I feel kind of separated 
from other people. Most of the people I know I would classify as 'good' people, 
which I would define as people trying to work on themselves. I think these 
techniques are like a moral boot camp, something that would clear up alot of 
issues for alot of people I know. But I also don't feel I can honestly tell 
anyone about them. I know there is a way forward that any fool can take who is 
dissatisfied with themselves, you don't need to pay fees and you will make 
progress. But I have to keep it a secret! It's hard.... that's all!

Sorry to whine, best wishes to all on the list, Jason
