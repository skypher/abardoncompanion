Johan, 

To me, you are right to me stopping a drug treatement if you see I 
does not improve your soon's health. 
It is your father responsability to do so. And don't worry, doctor 
science is not unlimitted, it is often more narrow than their Ego, 
their heart openning and real deep innner concern for their patient.
As for drugs, thinks of all the monney arround it. 
Do you really believe that Smithline Beeckam or Adventis are more 
concerned in helping manking or their shareholders' profit ? How 
would they keep on growing if there were no illness on Earth, if 
Bardon was taught in secondary school ?

However, a good follow-up with a good doctor (I mean not only from a 
medical point if view but from a human point of view) would 
definitely be helpfull. 
This person are difficult to find, but no doubt there is. If you 
trust your intuition, try to feel the doctor you meet and really look 
for the right person with medical knowledge, no doubt you will find 
him. Also, getting a good knowledge of your soon's illness is good.

To my opinion, an elemental will not really help your son, it will 
not FREE your son but make it dependant of something else. It is a 
far too dangerous path to link specifically an elemental to a 3 year 
old child. 

Epilepsy is a long term desease, but on the other hand a lot of great 
man were Epileptic (for example Alexander the Great in the Antics, 
bit I wish your son a more peacefull life). 

Helps, Care, Plants and also a good healer and pray (according to 
your own belief) can help. 

But the greatest help he can receive is yours. 
You can simply se what you learn in Step 1, i.e. food impregnation 
for help, Serinity, Quietness and Peace. Day by day, this creates 
strong energies for healing. 

You can also earn him to be concious of his body when he has 
epilepsic crisis, to relax, and also to ground himself -it means to 
energetically relates to the Earth. He will learn slowly to control 
the crisis. From a social point of view, you have to explain clairly 
what he has to school responsibles &amp; teachers. So that, they will not 
panic or be driven by fear (this may aplify symptoms).
When it will grow up, from 10/ 11 y.o, if could be able to control 
his crisis through Self Hypnosis technics. This is a very powerfull 
tools, it will make the illness something not so important, if not 
deseapear completely. 

We have potentially unlimmited power and are completely free in 
principles, but it is only on our destiny, not on other's one fate. 
It will help your son if you give him young the knowledge to developp 
and exercice this power. 

Best wishes. 


Pierre Mikael

&gt; Hi There,
&gt; 
&gt; Before asking my question let me first explain what the problem is.
&gt; 
&gt; My son Caelan is 3 years old and he causing me great concern.
&gt; 18 months ago he was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy.
&gt; He has never had a attack but the doctor assured me that he needs 
medication
&gt; urgently
&gt; as he would get worse soon. He was put on a drug called tegretol. 
Things got
&gt; worse.
&gt; As I manufacture herbal tinctures I took him off the tegretol and 
am giving
&gt; him a special
&gt; epilepsy tincture that I mix for him. This is helping but not as 
much as I
&gt; have hoped.
&gt; I am divorced and he lives with me. The thing is that he has 
aggressive
&gt; spells. Cries easily.
&gt; Wakes up crying. Never listens. He has the strongest will I have 
ever seen.
&gt; I envy him for that.
&gt; Besides that he is very intelligent and ahead in development for 
his age.
&gt; Besides that he has brainwaves that are &quot;different&quot; I believe the 
problem
&gt; might be more psycological.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is this: How can I use what I am doing in IIH to be of 
help to
&gt; him?
&gt; I am about to start with step 2.
&gt; I know that later in my work I could do a lot more.
&gt; If I am not advanced enough then could someone advanced not create a
&gt; elemental to help him?
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody with any thoughts or suggestions?
&gt; Many thanks in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards
&gt; 
&gt; Johan Pretorius
