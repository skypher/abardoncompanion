<pre>Greetings!

&lt;&lt;The &quot;purpose of the exercise&quot; is to &quot;kept my mind firmly focused 
&lt;&lt;upon the topic at hand&quot; and to &quot;shut out all other thoughts&quot;.

&lt;&lt;So how could this be &quot;cheating&quot;?

Hehehe... You hit the nail on the head, Rawn! You're a tricky one, 
using my own words to answer my own question!! ;-)

On a positive note, I've got something to share with you all that I 
am very excited about. I think I've figured out how the 
mental/astral/physical perception thing works!

Once I got the hang of it, it was quite easy to switch awareness 
between the different bodies (mental/astral/physical). From what I 
see, the perception of these bodies can be described as follows:

Mental : The essence of meaning inherent in observed objects.
Astral : The individual meaning inherent in observed objects.
Physical : The conglomerate of mental and astral perception, as well 
as the dimensional form/seperateness of observed object.

Take for instance my coffee-cup. Observing it from my mental body, I 
see &quot;container of liquid&quot;. From my astral body, I see &quot;my ol' 
trustworthy coffee-mug; a great present from my wife&quot;. Obviously, the 
descriptions above are but bits of the whole picture, and neither 
really comprises of language.

I find that by intently focusing solely upon the essential meaning of 
what I see before me, I sooner or later &quot;switch&quot; to this level of 
perception, so that it becomes the present mode of perception without 
effort. 

At work a couple of days ago, I tried a little experiment. I started 
looking at objects that I could see from the level of essential 
meaning (mental body), until the mode of observation came naturally. 
Then I looked at a jar whose contents I could not physically see. My 
mental observation, however, told me (not in words, but in meaning) 
something akin to &quot;Holding paper together&quot;. I went to look, and 
indeed the jar contained paper-clips! Now I didn't &quot;see&quot; paper-clips 
with my mental vision, but rather &quot;holding paper together&quot;, without 
any visual input. I was not surprised that the jar contained paper-
clips, although I never actually interpreted the essential meaning 
for the sake of the experiment.

I am rambling... I'm just very excited with my revelation. Now it is 
easy switching between mental and astral vision, by filtering out 
their principles, like radio-frequencies, from the other input. Of 
course, it is nothing like mental/astra wandering, since I am still 
observing from my physical body. Still, I consider it a big step 
forward.

Well met
Vovin
