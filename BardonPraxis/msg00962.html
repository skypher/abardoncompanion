<pre>Hello,

This is my first message to the BardonPraxis group so let me first
say hello to everyone and what a good place this is for open and interesting 
experience
and knowledge sharing! 

I am on my way through step one of Bardon's IIH, and I do sometimes
like to meditate or at least relax and just let everything go and listen to
my body/mind flowing with energy/thoughts.
When I do this, just like you my eyelids do not close completely and my
right one seems to like to open when I relax my face.
I found two interesting things that may help you as well:

- If I am starting the relaxation, and my face is still wide &quot;awake&quot;, the
eyelids seem to be closed (because I am forcing them, althought not 
intentionaly)
but when I start to relax, the muscles relax and
the lids go to, what I believe, their &quot;normal&quot; position for my current 
relaxation
level (i.e. if i am still wide awake and try to relax my face, they will be 
half open but
if I am already quite relaxed, they will be almost 100% closed)

- Still, my right eyelid stays open just a bit most of the times unless I am 
very relaxed.
What I usually do is turn the lights off and just forget about it! I also 
started to do it
with medium lights on and &quot;train&quot; to forget about it... what happends is that 
you don't
care anymore about the light that comes through and at the same time because you
are relaxing, it will ultimatly close by itself! (well, actually im still 
trying to completely
forget about that light but I had some progress already... which means this 
could
actually work eheh)

I hope this can somehow help you!

All the best,

Paulo Cunha

&gt; Subject: Flickering eyes
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; After achieving a certain humility and working through Step One 
&gt; (again), I've finally re-achieved Step Two, only to discover a rather
&gt; irritating problem of a physical nature.
&gt; 
&gt; Whenever I close my eyes to visualize, my eyelids start wanting to 
&gt; flicker open, my left one more so than the right. Of course, this 
&gt; disrupts my concentration (since I would have one eye open and one 
&gt; eye closed in the midst of the exercise). After a few days of this, 
&gt; I've experimented and found that I do the exercise better with my 
&gt; eyes open. I've also tried holding my eyes shut with a hand and that
&gt; enabled me to visualize as I normally would, but naturally that is not the
&gt; way to do it. The whole thing is rather disheartening, especially since I
&gt; know that either of these &quot;shortcuts&quot; would just set me further back than
&gt; this flaw does.
&gt; 
&gt; I am, of course, working on my elemental balance as anyone on Step 
&gt; Two would, but this strikes me as being a problem of a more physical
&gt; nature. It only happens whenever I'm doing this particular exercise;
&gt; whenever I'm going to sleep and thinking my good thoughts for the day, it
&gt; doesn't happen. It might be psychological, but I've never had this problem
&gt; before.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that it's not exactly a philosophical dilemma that requires 
&gt; the shifting of one's entire paradigm, but... blast, is this 
&gt; annoying! Has anyone else had this problem before?
&gt;
