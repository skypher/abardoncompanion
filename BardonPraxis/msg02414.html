<pre>Dear Rawn,

-----------------------------------------------
We fear disease and fear witnessing another suffer, so 
we tend to think
of illness and suffering as a negative things that must 
be obliterated
as soon as possible and by whatever means available. 
However, from a
perspective of Universal Legality, illness is a gift 
that is meant to
teach us an important karmic lesson that we have not 
been able to learn
in the absence of disease. A healer interferes with a 
patient's karma
the moment they remove the symptoms of disease without 
assuring that the
patient does indeed learn the lesson that the disease 
was meant to teach
them. If the patient does not learn the karmic lesson 
then what the
&quot;healer&quot; has done is taken away an opportunity for the 
patient's growth.
That specific opportunity that the &quot;healer&quot; has taken 
away was the most
appropriate way that was available for the patient to 
learn their karmic
lesson. This means that the patient will still have to 
learn that
lesson, either by other means or by a recurrence of the 
same disease
that the &quot;healer&quot; has just treated.

---------------------------------------

I must say, at first that I do not come from an 
hermetic root, at least not at this incarnation, 
although many of the hermetic principles I have been 
studing I have found similar to those I bring in my 
heart.

I would like to point out my opinion on the matter, 
concerning our &quot;interference&quot; with other people's karma.
I have heard time and time again people giving the 
convenient excuse that they should do nothing to help 
other people because it would interfere with their 
karma, and therefore the &quot;helper&quot; would be creating a 
karma debt for himself as well as complications for the 
person being helped.
Although that is not the case with your work Rawn, I 
think some of the principles here apply, so that is why 
I took the liberty to answer this post.

I think, first of all, the whole matter is very simple 
and resolved by 2 major conceptions.

First, to think that by *helping* we are interfering 
with other persons karma, needs, spiritual development 
and thus we are surplanting the divine providence and 
Laws concerning that person is simply something out of 
uncounscious arrogance and lazyness. Although we are 
trully capable of channeling the divine energy into 
creative applications, to think we can change a 
person's path and the things that person has to deal 
with during it existence and growth is to think us 
equal to the ALL (although we are divine in essence and 
capable of divine creation, we are not the ALL). Also, 
that kind of thinking hides (in my opinion) the 
unmistakable and confortable reasoning as to why we 
shouldn't do anything about it and not intervine.

Second, and this I think is clear, since we are not the 
ALL and although we can aquire a great deal and power 
of clairvoyance to percieve one's conditions and needs, 
simply because we are not the ALL it is silly to think 
we can know *everything* concerning one's needs and 
growth, and sufferings and karma. Also, we cannot 
forget that everything acts, atracts each other and 
happens according to the similarity in frequency of 
vibration. Therefore, I believe that if the divine 
providence has put someone in your way so you can help 
her, then it is part of your responsability to help 
her. Of course it will be according to you, your 
counscious being and your stage in evolution to come to 
terms with that realizations and do help her (we still 
have free will after all). But that answers the 
question. Even so if we remeber that many, many, many 
people gives up loads of money for new suicidal 
religions and don't do anything to sincerely help 
others (by their own mind) with that money... different 
beings operating in the same frequency attracts each 
other... and if we also remember that, no matter what 
we do have to go through there are many extra corporeal 
beings helping us whenever our vibrating frequency 
allows, even though our karma states that we must go 
through a lot of situations (specially because we 
attracted them to ourselves and only through them can 
we grow up), that points out the fact that we should 
help no matter what.

Rawn, as to your working group and your philosophy of 
work, this is not really directed to you, exactly 
because those considerations of yours are not meant as 
excuse not to act... On the contrary you *are* acting. 
Even so, the way I see the matter, and as I try to work 
with it in my everyday life differ from yours in this 
way.

Sorry if I rambled too much,

Best regards,
Decio
