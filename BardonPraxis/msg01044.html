<pre>Dear Rawn,
Thank you for your reply, it's very enlightening. I must confess that
planetary associations (to do with Quaballah I presume) confuse me -
but I can now tell people knowledgeably that they are smoking Venus
and Mercury Marijuana :) It is also interesting to learn that the
plant is particularely sensitive and intelligent.
Thanks,
M

P.S. Thanks to everyone else for your responses aswell

&gt; Dear M.,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Does this mean that at some stage in your development you turn onto a
&gt; permanent cannabis like trip? &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; ;-) Not exactly, no. One distinct difference is the fact that with
&gt; cannabis (or any other such mind altering substance), you can't turn the
&gt; heightened perception and mental functioning, on and off at will.
&gt; Unless, that is, you've developed very strong mental discipline.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, does anybody know how this plant could help Magic studies? - I
&gt; am thinking about trying it. &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; The planetary associations of this herb are Venus and Mercury, which
&gt; well describes its ability to pleasantly ease open the mind and create a
&gt; certain harmony between emotion and rational intellect. This can lead
&gt; to either positive or negative effects. For example, it can inspire
&gt; your mind or it can put you in a stupor.
&gt; 
&gt; Which pole it manifests depends upon many factors, foremost of which is
&gt; the nature of the individual ingesting it. The effects of cannabis upon
&gt; the human body vary greatly from person to person and from strain to
&gt; strain. Some strains of cannabis WILL put you in a stupor, no matter
&gt; what! ;-) And other strains will barely effect your body, while vastly
&gt; liberating your mind.
&gt; 
&gt; The living cannabis plant itself is very intelligent and highly
&gt; sensitive to the &quot;vibe&quot; surrounding it. It has a great affinity for
&gt; humanity and has been used by human beings for unknown thousands of
&gt; years, as everything from food, to clothing, to medicine. It's only
&gt; been over the past several decades that it has been grown under some
&gt; pretty bizarre conditions and often with all kinds of nasty chemicals
&gt; involved. All of these things change the herb from its pristine state
&gt; due to its intelligence and sensitivity. [The primary psychoactive
&gt; parts of the cannabis flower are housed in a crystalline form, which is
&gt; ideal for capturing &quot;vibes&quot;, so to speak.] So it's important (for
&gt; magical use) to ingest only organically grown cannabis, preferably grown
&gt; outdoors with loving care.
&gt; 
&gt; While cannabis offers many good attributes, the main negative in terms
&gt; of magical training, is the issue of not being able to turn its effect
&gt; on and off at will. During the training, it's *vitally* important that
&gt; you learn how to reach the mental states you need to reach *on your own,
&gt; by your own will and not become dependant upon cannabis as a crutch to
&gt; reach those states*.
&gt; 
&gt; This is especially important during the Step One mental exercises. If
&gt; you do these while you still have the effects of cannabis in your
&gt; system, then you will not be observing your *normal* state of mind in
&gt; the first exercise; will not be gaining control over your *normal* state
&gt; of mind (which has a few different rules than the mind on cannabis!) in
&gt; the second exercise; and will not learn how to reach a VOM from a
&gt; *normal* state of mind in the third exercise.
&gt; 
&gt; It can also interfere with the development of the Step Two, sensory
&gt; concentrations. These exercises really must be mastered with the
&gt; normally functioning mind, otherwise a dependence upon the cannabis can
&gt; easily develop and you'll find yourself unable to visualize, audiolize,
&gt; etc., when you're not high.
&gt; 
&gt; But once you've achieved strong mental discipline, this is not so much
&gt; of an issue so long as you do learn to master the exercises without the
&gt; help of the cannabis.
&gt; 
&gt; I find Cannabis to be a very friendly, pleasant and beneficial herb. It
&gt; is not however, a replacement for hard work, nor is it a short cut.
&gt; 
&gt; My best to you,
&gt; :) Rawn Clark
