<pre>Thank you so much, Rawn and Andrew also. I feel much better about the 
concept. I actually discussed my problem with my son, who also is starting 
to work with the IIH, he found the color question confusing too, and we both 
kind of started to think about the possibility of mixing apples and oranges...
I did visit your fantastic website right after joining the group and did draw 
the color circle and I will use those for the main color concept. I'm sure, 
eventually everything will fall into place.
I also downloaded your Archaeus for self healing, the first two parts so far, 
(each takes about an hour to download), and listened to the introduction. 
Your work is awesome, and I want to thank you for making it available to all 
of us.

For the first time since a long time I'm getting exited, - I finally found 
the right path and a great teacher to boot!

You are mixing apples with oranges, Fluids with Elements, astral body
with physical body, etc. ;-)

The Element Water *contains* the Magnetic Fluid but is not the Magnetic
Fluid. Or rather, it is the Magnetic Fluid expressed at a more complex
level of density. Thus it displays somewhat different characteristics
than the raw Fluid. I think Bardon chose the color green to represent
the Water Element in order to distinguish between its characteristics
and those of the blue Magnetic Fluid. Furthermore, green is the
chromatic opposite of red and this accurately depicts the opposition of
the Elements Fire and Water. The Fluids however,do not share the same
sort of opposition as the Elements.

In my own practice, I do not use Bardon's color correspondences for the
Elements. I use: Fire=bright red, Air=yellow, Water=cyan blue, and
Earth=dark olive green or brown or black. In relation to these
Elemental colors, I find that the Electric Fluid=blood red and the
Magnetic Fluid=true blue.

Since the colors are *symbolic* they are, to a great degree, subjective
and thus, they vary from individual to individual. For example, when
you think of 'red' it is, invariably, a somewhat different shade of red
than what I automatically think of, yet both could be classified as
'red'.

For now, don't worry about the Fluids and the &quot;occult anatomy&quot;. The
most important thing for now would be the &quot;Elemental regions&quot; since they
pertain to all three of your bodies: physical, astral and mental. With
the physical body, the Fire region is the neck and head; the Air region
is from the shoulders down to the diaphragm, including the upper arms
down to the elbow; the Water region is from the diaphragm down to the
pelvis (i.e., the abdominal cavity), including the forearms from elbows
to wrists; and the Earth region (not mentioned on page 33, but mentioned
later on) is from the pelvis down to the soles of the feet, including
the genetalia and the hands.

This division into four regions has many practical applications in the
beginning work of IIH; whereas, the &quot;occult anatomy&quot; of the Fluids does
not.

I think you might benefit from the audio lessons in the &quot;Self-Healing
Archaeous&quot; posted on my website. The first three Lessons in this series
concern the complete awareness and integration of the three bodies and
employ the four Elemental regions as a basic, experiential structure.
You can download them at:
<a  href="../MP3-Links.html">http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/MP3-Links.html</a> or order them in
audio-CD format at: <a  href="../CDs.html">http://www.ABardonCompanion.com/CDs.html</a>

&gt;&gt; Somehow I think I'm missing something, probably something very
obvious. But I feel stuck right now, not understanding my very own
microcosm at all. Can somebody help unravel the color knots in my head
and set me straight? Hey now! don't laugh about me!!! :-{}&lt;&lt;

I'm not laughing. :) The answer to your quandary is NOT something
&quot;very obvious&quot;, so don't feel embarrassed!

My best to you,
:) Rawn Clark
