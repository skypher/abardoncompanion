Hi,

I don't know anything about any specific Hermetic writings or 
techniques on the topic of self-defense, but my personal opinion is 
that part of the living work of Hermetic practice is to continually 
bring practical, day-to-day existence into communion with higher law 
through one's own contemplation and actions. It's the same as with 
healing, where all the levels have to be addressed: physical, 
astral/emotional, and mental. In this analogy of healing, if I 
experience pain, I apply techniques to stop the pain; I open my 
awareness to the emotional experience of the pain; I investigate the 
root of the pain and contemplate what meaning it has and what it has 
to teach me.

It sounds like a very difficult situation you are in and certainly 
it would be a tremendous challenge to anyone's sense of security and 
equilibrium in the world. I don't have such experience with the 
threat of violence, but if I were in that situation, I think I would 
first focus on what things to do to keep me and my loved ones alive 
and safe for the immediate present, and turn to Hermetic practice to 
help me make sense of all that is happening and how to deal with it 
both emotionally and in a long-term sense, e.g. in terms of soul 
mirror work and character transformation.


My two cents, for what it's worth.
David

&gt; HI!
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering if any of the practicioners in the group have 
found a way to integrate some form of self-defense training into 
their Hermetic practices. Whether physical or with the use of magic.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I'm asking is because I live in a 3rd world country 
where crime is very much rampant. And yet I find myself inexplicably 
drawn to Bardons system, even though I do not seem to have made any 
concrete progress for the past 3 years.
&gt; 
&gt; Given that the practice of Hermetics, work, and family life takes 
up a large part of my day. I'd still feel more complete if I found a 
way to incorporate some form of self-defense in my training. For my 
and my loved ones sake, if ever the time came if they were 
threatened by another human being.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, what would be (if there was any) appropriate view and action 
of a Hermetic in practice with regards to incidents where his or his 
loved ones life/welfare is threatened by common criminals. Forgive 
me if this topic was taken up already before, I must have missed it.
&gt; 
&gt; Any or no comments will be appreciated.
