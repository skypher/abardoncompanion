<pre>Peter:

I must cautiously attempt to give my perspective since I haven't had that much 
practice with evocation (well - not any in THIS life but in previous ones) but 
I do occasionally mentally contact a few. What guides ME is it depends on what 
type of problems are occuring in my life, their special nature, and the 
specialty of a spirit. I have found that the more spiritual issues (eg. how to 
Self improve for better service to mankind, etc.) generate a far more favorable 
response. By the way it is inadvisable to contact Emrudue for the reasons 
suggested on a popular website. Trust me.

Dear group...well...really Rawn specifically, but anyways,

Alright, advanced question time. Rawn has already gone over the 
reasons for performing evocation in previous correspondences, but 
no-one has ever really gone over why one should evoke one particular 
entity over another. For when Bardon speaks of the Book of Magical 
Formulae the first item that he places in the forefront is 1. Purpose 
of the operation. Should the purpose be just to evoke the being? Learn 
what it has to say, to teach you? To have a sense of communion with 
something that is outside the normal realm of human consciousness in 
an attempt to expand one's own consciousness so that it can garner a 
better understanding of the divine? Or should it be to have the spirit 
perform a specific task? Something that should, most likely be 
practiced once a good rapport has been made with that particular 
spirit.

Bardon states, &quot;When the magician has become sufficiently acquainted 
with the zone girdling the earth, so that he has contacts with some of 
its heads, especially the masters of magic, he may start trying to get 
into contact with intelligences of the Moon sphere.&quot; How many spirits 
should one come in contact with to become &quot;sufficently acquainted with 
the zone girdling the earth&quot;? I know that in some areas of PME Bardon 
seems to imply that to master the sphere one needs to evoke quite a 
number, if not all of the heads of that particular sphere. Which 
sometimes boggles my mind given the number of spirits that Bardon 
lists throughout PME. If he was in personal contact with each of these 
spirits...even over the course of many years it would almost seem as 
if he would be performing an evocation or more every day over the 
course of at several years. Personally when I work an evocation, I 
often feel physically drained, and usually quite hungry afterwords. In 
contrast to this sense of physical fatigue there is an extreme sense 
of peace and exhileration upon the astral and mental bodies...

Love and Live well,
Peter Reist
