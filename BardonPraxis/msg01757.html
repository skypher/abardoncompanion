&gt; Dear David,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; What do I do if I am trying to practice emptiness
&gt; of mind and
&gt; hypnagogic (pre-sleep) imagery keeps coming up? 
&gt; They aren't entirely
&gt; consciously controlled, more like random images that
&gt; pop into my
&gt; head, and my mind is fuzzied from fatigue or
&gt; something so I have a
&gt; harder time focusing. Should I just refrain from
&gt; EOM practice if I
&gt; am somewhat sleepy, or is this a common phenomenon
&gt; which represents
&gt; the next layer of &quot;thoughts&quot; to be eliminated? &lt;&lt;

A few months ago I was practicing observation alot.
(maybe too much) And it enabled me to remain
conscious of the sleep images instead of actually
falling asleep. I noticed there were varying degrees
of sleep and awakeness. Between consciousness and
unconsciousness, this was &quot;the fullest intensity&quot; of
sleep and waking at the same time. I had full control
of thoses images but I was not rationally awake. So I
was willfully combining those image-ideas with each
other through negation and synthesis. It was like
thinking &quot;dark, no light; suffering, no learning to
become happy; I'm lazy, no I don't identify with
that.&quot; Eventually I reached a point where all the
ideas and images formed a single point, and they were
all connected together. This produced a huge amount
of energy that ran through the body like a bolt of
lightning and gathered at the crown. The state of
mind was not rational and felt like insanity. The
main thing that produced this was negative-negative
thinking with observation throughout the day, which
transfered to the semi sleep state. How would you
explain the synthesis of those sleep-images in
magickal terms? Is the final state the EOM? I don't
think it was because the mind wasn't really empty, it
was full and there were no more opposites. Also, in
EOM are you not aware of yourself as an ego? 

Sincerely,
Dustin
