<h1 align=justify><B>More Clarification of TMO Lesson Six</B></h1>
<p align=justify>&copy; 2005<br>
  <br>
  &gt;&gt; <I>Last session was good. I made significant progress on the lesson 6 after I reread the script of the lesson and noticed that I had misinterpreted a significant bit about the eruption of the ADNI light. All this time, I hadn&#39;t realized that the ADNI light had to be raised all the way back to Kether after it had stricken Malkuth. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  I really need to re-write and then re-record those Lessons! :) As time passes and more and more folks pursue TMO through the Lessons, I&#39;m learning the points where I wasn&#39;t clear enough, and this is one of them.<br>
  <br>
  When I wrote, &quot;When the light strikes Malkuth with force and the ADNI rainbow-hued light erupts, it rises all the way back up to Kether&quot;, I didn&#39;t mean that *you* need to consciously or intentionally raise it all the way up to Kether at that point. Instead, what I meant to explain there was that the Adonai Light, once it has erupted at the Malkuth level, *exists* at all five levels. It does this naturally, without your having to &quot;raise&quot; it up, because this is the nature of the Adonai Light -- it exists at, and encompasses, all five levels simultaneously just as soon as it erupts in Malkuth. The reason it does this, or has this property, is due to the fact that it is the unification of all five of these levels of *your* Self that causes the Adonai Light to &quot;erupt&quot; in the first place. Therefore, by nature, it exists in Kether simultaneous to its existing in Malkuth. However, *from the Malkuth perspective* this simultaneity of existence is *perceived* as the Adonai Light &quot;rising&quot; upward to Kether.<br>
  <br>
  &gt;&gt; <I>Every time I would send the ADNI light outward, I would inexplicably be unable to maintain my heightened awareness and would be dragged from my heightened perspective back to Malkuth and send the light from there. I now understand that this was due to my forgetting to raise the ADNI light from Malkuth upwards prior to its sending outwards. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  Instead of raising it yourself, I suggest that you *perceive the fact that it exists on all five levels of your Self* as soon as it erupts.<br>
  <br>
  &gt;&gt; <I>Question: When performing TMO from the Binah perspective, is my interpretation correct when I stop the upward rising ADNI light in Binah prior to its sending outwards? or should I raise the ADNI light all the way back to Kether prior to its sending outwards from Binah? (this last solution makes little sense to me.) </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  Okay, once the Adonai Light erupts in Malkuth, perceive its apparent rise upward and let your focus of awareness *rise with* the Adonai Light upward until you are once again focused in your Binah. The Adonai Light *exists* on all five levels of your Self simultaneously, but since your focus of awareness is in Binah, the major focus of the Adonai Light will also be in your Binah and it will thus appear/feel that the Adonai Light itself has been raised to your Binah. In essence, the Adonai Light will follow your focus of awareness; or rather, it will focus where your awareness is focused. <br>
  <br>
  Furthermore, since the Adonai Light exists on all five levels of your Self simultaneously, it provides a medium, so to speak, within which it is very easy for you to move your focus of awareness around from level to level, or to expand your focus of awareness so that it includes several or all the levels of your Self simultaneously. The Adonai Light provides a very fluid medium that is itself rooted in the unification of *your* own levels of Self.<br>
  <br>

</p>
<p align=justify><br>
  &gt;&gt; <I>It seems to contain so much scope and many potential avenues of investigation. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  Yes, it does. :) However, please remember that you do not need to explore and &quot;master&quot; every single possibility. ;-) That would, quite literally, take *at least* one entire lifetime! ;-) Besides, it is not necessary -- in the same sense that in IIH it is not *necessary* to become so proficient with the Elements that you can dry wet towels on your body with the Fire Element or freeze water with the Water Element, etc..<br>
  <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>I certainly perceived the differences in perception/sensation between the five levels. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
    Wonderful! :)<br>
    <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>Binah felt powerful, yet heavier - more commanding and controlling. Chokmah felt calm and centered, very detached from the physical - in control and powerful, yet gentler and less willful, which strikes the logical part of me as strange seeing how Chokmah is linked to Fire and Binah to Water. Is not Fire very willful and harsh? Hmmm. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  In the temporal realm, the Fire Principle manifests as a positive *or* as a negative. In the temporal realm, the negative manifestation of the Fire Principle is indeed destructive and harsh, and its positive manifestation is invigorating, life-giving and promotes growth. At the non-temporal, eternal level of Chokmah (and Binah) however, the Principle of Fire is not polarized into negative and positive. Therefore, the *experience or perception* of its effect at the eternal level is one of ease. It&#39;s still VERY Force-ful (infinitely so) but it is not *experienced* as having any negative or destructive effects *within the eternal realm*.<br>
  <br>
  Many of our initial ideas about the archetypal opposites of Fire and Water are colored by things we have been taught by others and not by our own personal experiences with the Elements. But as your experience with the Elements increases, it&#39;s inevitable that your understanding of the Elements themselves will evolve considerably from any pre-conceived notions. :) We are *taught* to think of Fire as &quot;masculine&quot; and thus related to the gender-role most men learn of harshness, willfulness, etc. When we think of &quot;Fire&quot;, we think of Mars, war, destruction, etc., because that is the way that our cultures have taught us to think. The thing is, that is just a small part of what Fire *is*! ;-) And in order to truly wield the Elements, one must set aside those learned pre-conceptions and focus instead upon their direct experience.<br>
  <br>
  <I>&gt;&gt; I have a question regarding carrying out the canticle from the Kethric perspective. Am I to visualise the Kethric light descending to the other spheres below me and the ADNI light rising up? When I performed it, it was as if it all happened on the Kethric plane and the other planes were included, but not separate, so that there was no sense of movement, only expansion and contraction (if that&#39;s not a contradiction in terms)... but should the *rainbow* light still be visualised (and if so, at what point?) or is it purely Kethric light at this level? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
    To quote from the introduction:<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;In Kether itself, there is no experience of light for it becomes clear that what is perceived from below as light, is in truth consciousness. From the perspective of Unity, everything is composed of this consciousness, of the essence of the Unity itself. Thus Kether is a whole thing, not a mere unity of parts. It is potential and actualization, simultaneously.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;From the Kethric perspective of the Ani, the Unitary consciousness emanates into Chokmah and from there into the entire realm of BEing. When it reaches Chokmah, it is then directed - as light -- by the Chokmah Self into whatever direction is desired.&quot;<br>
  <br>
    For the purposes of *Lesson Six*, this is what you should do. :)<br>
    <br>
    Start with the repetitions of &quot;Ani&quot; until you feel satisfied that your awareness is focused in Kether to the best of your ability. Then, as you say the &quot;Yod&quot;, shift your focus of awareness into Chokmah where it *becomes* Light and descend *with* the **Kethric** Light through the sequence into your Malkuth. Let the Adonai Light erupt and *while it is erupting in your Malkuth*, expand your focus of awareness so that you are present with the **rainbow-hued Adonai Light** in Kether. &#91;Remember what I wrote to Olivier about the fact that once the Adonai Light erupts in Malkuth, it exists simultaneously on all five levels of your Self.&#93; This focuses the Adonai Light at your Kether. Then impregnate the Adonai Light as you wish and perform the &quot;Ribonno Shel Olam&quot; *from* Kether. Which is to say, *emanate* the **rainbow-hued Adonai Light** *from* Kether &quot;down&quot; into Chokmah, Binah, Tiphareth and Malkuth. This is nothing more than expanding your focus of awareness so that it encompasses your Malkuth self as-well-as your Kether, Chokmah, Binah and Tiphareth Selves. To end with the &quot;Amen&quot;, draw your primary focus back to your Kether.<br>
    <br>
    From the Kethric perspective, this is like taking two breaths. Exhale &#35;1 = emanation of the Kethric Light &quot;down&quot; to your Malkuth and eruption of the Adonai Light. Inhale &#35;1 = raising/refocusing of the awareness to Kether and focusing of the Adonai Light at Kether. Exhale &#35;2 = &quot;Ribonno Shel Olam&quot; and the sending of the Adonai Light down into the universe. Inhale &#35;2 = the return wave of the Adonai Light unto Kether.<br>
    <br>
    So, you descend with the Kethric Light during the IHVH, but are working with the rainbow-hued Adonai Light thereafter.<br>
    <br>
    My best to you,<br>
