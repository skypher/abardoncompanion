<h1 align=left><B>Genesis, Chapter 1 &amp; Human Superiority</B></h1>
<p align=left>&copy; 2002<br>
    <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>This is a very, very big issue and certainly needs to be discussed and clarified. I have subsequently noticed in fact that FB actually initially goes as far as saying that, and I quote, &quot;The true image of God is the Human Being, who has been created in the image of the universe&quot;.&nbsp; Now that is a *very* definitive statement which can easily be interpreted as Humans being *the* superior race of beings in any form throughout the entire universe. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
      <br>
      It *can* be interpreted that way, yes. But if you very carefully examine Bardon&#39;s statement he&#39;s saying that the physical universe (which includes ALL things) reflects the structure of the Unity (the Akashic, mental, astral and physical planes combined) and that the human being also reflects this structure. In essence, this is saying that EVERY thing reflects this structure. This is not really a statement pointing out the difference or uniqueness of the human being -- it&#39;s saying that EVERY thing has the same structure.<br>
      <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>I still go back to the statement &quot;Human Being&quot; in this context. And is has to be said, that regardless of whether there are other intelligent life forms in the cosmos, Man occupies some very high ground due to our unique intelligence in Earth Corporeal terms. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
        <br>
        We are indeed unique but we are in no way superior. Our consciousness differs only very, very slightly from many other forms of life on our own planet, and difference has nothing at all to do with superiority. The rest of the planet thinks we are anything but superior. To the rest of our earth, we are desctructive, parasitic creatures.<br>
        <br>
        It always amuses me when spiritually minded folk talk about how we must destroy the little ego with one breath, and then with the very next breath, speak about how superior human begins are in the grand scheme of things. To my mind, THAT is the sort of egotism that must needs be destroyed! ;-)<br>
        <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>It would appear, on the face of it, when comparing us to other fauna, that we have differentiated ourselves (or have been differentiated) dramatically. The question is - is this cosmos wide or just Earth wide? And what of other life? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  The Step Four mental work of the transference of your mental body into other creatures and things will (rather rudely) answer many of these questions for you. That specific work is VERY transformative. When you begin to see the world from other non-human perspectives, it is very humbling. Until you experience the differences from a non-human perspective, you cannot grasp the significance of the similarities.<br>

  &gt;&gt; <I>I agree with you. I certainly regard *all* life forms as equal. But the point I was making is that mankind has been entrusted, due to its - well - shall we say a &quot;unique&quot; or &quot;trusted&quot; position of responsibility on this planet in terms of its degree of control. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  I don&#39;t see any evidence to support the idea that humans have been entrusted with this responsibility. It is not a responsibility, it&#39;s merely an ability. There&#39;s a big difference between these two things. The human idea that we are responsible for controlling this planet is a rationalization and attempted justification for our own unwise use of our ability. It is a human delusion. It is at the root of the schism within the human group mind. It is what prevents us from living in harmony with our planet and our fellow creatures.<br>
  <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>To put it another way, whereas most life forms exist in the environment they were provided with, and are content to do so, man has the ability to modify or destroy it, and does so without apparent regard for flora and fauna. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  It&#39;s interesting to note that your description of most life forms (that they exist in harmony with the objective universe) is also the definition of Wisdom and of what it means to be an Adept.<br>

<p align=left><br>
  &gt; &gt; <I>The main problem I have with the former, and I have just got to get my mind around, is the symbolism of Genesis.&nbsp; My problem is, that even in the written order of things, it is at odds with my extensive studies and knowledge of evolution from a scientific, factual point of view. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
    To begin with, the Genesis story has nothing to do with the physical world.<br>
    <br>
    In kabbalah, there are three essential phases to &quot;creation&quot;. The first is Briah (creation proper). Briah occurs non-sequentially and is a feature of the eternal realm. This is the phase to which Genesis refers.<br>
    <br>
    However, it is impossible to describe a non-sequential thing with sequential words without introducing sequence. It&#39;s like a scientist trying to describe the sequence of events within the &quot;big bang&quot;, things which occurred in nano-seconds. Take that a step further and remove the factor of sequence entirely and you&#39;ll see the problem. Non-sequential reality just cannot be described with any accuracy with sequential words, period. But that doesn&#39;t prevent us from trying and the Genesis One story is one such attempt.<br>
    <br>
    Creation occurred/occurs all at once, in the eternal sense, and is enacted throughout the entire infinite span of the sequential reality.<br>
    <br>
    The second phase is Yetzirah (formation). This IS sequential but is not referred to in Genesis. Formation concerns the &quot;lower&quot; sequential aspects of the mental realm and the entire astral realm. The &quot;Sepher Yetzirah&quot; (Book of Formation) is where you&#39;ll find the story of Formation.<br>
    <br>
    The third phase is Assiah (making) and this concerns the &quot;lower&quot; astral and the material realms. Assiah is also not referred to in Genesis One, nor is it referred to in the Sepher Yetzirah.<br>
    <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>Genesis, as written and translated, in my humble view, entirely reflects the level of scientific and astronomical knowledge of mankind at the time Genesis was written.</I> &lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  Only the symbols that the author used to express the higher concepts, reflect this. The concepts themselves, aside from the symbols they&#39;re clothed in, have nothing to do with material knowledge.<br>
  <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>In this context, how would you interpret Genesis 1:12, 1:21 and 1:26? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  <B>Gen 1:12 -- &quot;And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind, and fruit-tree bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after its kind; and Elohim saw that it was good.&quot;</B><br>
  <br>
  Here we are defining the types of consciousness or mental density. This passage refers to the type of consciousness that is *similar to* that which inhabits plants within the physical realm. In terms of the &quot;evolution&quot; of types of consciousness, this does indeed proceed the following --<br>
  <br>
  <B>Gen 1:21 -- &quot;And Elohim created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after its kind, and every winged fowl after its kind;&quot;</B><br>
  <br>
    Here we have the types of consciousness that are suitable for inhabiting the Elemental realms of Air and Water.<br>
    <br>
    <B>Gen 1:26 -- &quot;And Elohim said: &#39;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.&#39;&quot;<br>
    </B><br>
  The Hebrew word ADM (&quot;man&quot;) is a very complex word. I analyze it to some extent in &quot;A Path To Understanding&quot;. At any rate, it means more than just human life or even human-type consciousness. Here, Elohim is setting the stage for Yetzirah and the descent into matter that necessitates Yetzirah.<br>
  <br>
  Whereas the earlier passages referred to the types of consciousness suitable for inhabiting the Elemental realms, this passage refers to the type suitable for inhabiting an astral and, eventually, a material realm.<br>
  <br>
  Since this is the ultimate level of density so far as consciousness-types, it is inclusive of the previous types mentioned in Genesis One. This is the sense in which &quot;dominion&quot; is meant. <br>
  <br>

<p align=left><br>
  &gt;&gt; <I>In physical world existence terms, I am often asked whether I am a &quot;creationist&quot; or &quot;evolutionist&quot;, and I say both. Creation had to occur before the evolution of life on the physical world could take place at all.</I> &lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve considered the deeper implications of what I said about creation (Briah) being an eternal, non-sequential act. This IS difficult to wrap one&#39;s mind around! ;-)<br>
  <br>
  At any rate, an eternal act encompasses the whole infinite span of the temporal realm. In other words, our temporal realm is the sequential enactment of that eternal act of creation. The creation is not something that happen_ed. Rather, it&#39;s something that&#39;s happen_ing.&nbsp; Evolution IS creation, and vise versa. They are just different dimensions of the same thing.<br>
  <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>This whole aspect also serves to highlight, that despite its scientific complexity and obvious mundane visibility, the physical universe is really only the lowest manifestation of a much, much greater and more expansive work - a work which is the realms of the Magician and Kabbalist, and simply not recognized even by the vast majority of people, or even by religions and the most advanced modern science. </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  This is not entirely accurate although that is how it *appears*. In truth, the material realm is inseparable from the rest of the cosmos.&nbsp; These other realms permeate and cause the physical realm. It is only the sequentialized humanoid consciousness that subjectively perceives the physical realm as a separate thing.<br>
  <br>
  The material realm is also not the nadir of a linear hierarchy as your words imply. In truth, it is one spot on an endless loop. It is part of an integral cycle that has no true linear hierarchy.<br>
  <br>
  The *appearance* of linearity, hierarchy, etc., is a distortion caused by the subjectifying mechanisms of human perception.<br>
  <br>

</p>
<p align=left><br>
  &gt;&gt; <I>For a while now I&#39;ve been pondering the concept of the Evolution of the Spirit. Given the ultimate goal of Hermetics to become one with g-d and given that this can be achieved through the human spirit, and assuming that animals have lesser evolved spirits, is there a point at which an animal spirit is promoted so-to-speak and re-incarnated as a human so as to eventually also be able to merge with the g-d ?</I> &lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
  I don&#39;t find any evidence to support this &quot;Evolution of the Spirit&quot; hypothesis. Each type of sequentialized consciousness (spirit) follows the same path to Unity. An animalian spiritus does not need to evolve into a human spiritus in order to achieve Unity. The human-type spiritus is no more nor less capable of achieving Unity, nor is it any closer to Unity than any other type of spiritus. Each is just *different*. None is superior or inferior to another.<br>
  <br>
  The Step Four work of the transference of one&#39;s consciousness into other life forms makes these things self-evident. It becomes quickly apparent that this hypothesis of human superiority is just a human delusion.<br>
  <br>
