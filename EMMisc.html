<h1 align=left><B>Eucharistic Magic Miscellany&nbsp; &#91;Replies by Rawn and EMC.&#93;</B></h1>
<p align=left>&copy; 2002<br>
    <br>
&gt;&gt; <I>Can some of you more experienced people describe what Bardon means by &quot;embodying your wish in your food&quot;? I understand what he means when wishing for emotional things like health, tranquility, and inner peace, but what about abilities? It doesn&#39;t make sense to me to say &quot;As I eat this food, I am eating the ability to visualize&quot; or &quot;I am eating the ability to control my thoughts&quot;. What would be the best way to phrase these thoughts so that the wish can be most effective? </I>&lt;&lt;<br>
    <br>
    <B>Reply by EMC:</B><br>
  <br>
  What I kind of skimmed over, but came back and &quot;re-learned&quot; subsequently in that step is the importance of the 5 words &quot;with the intensest possible imagination&quot; ... what proved most effective, for me, wasn&#39;t the words but imagining the intent as-if I already possessed the ability I desired and this very ability created by the magical properties of the food I was eating.<br>
  <br>
  So as I ate I imagined I could feel the ability to visualize vividly awakening within me. It may help if you flip from 1st person perspective to watching yourself in the 3rd person and &quot;see/feel/imagine&quot; the energy of this intent setting your form aglow. You notice that this person has incredible visualization skills. You imagine what it must be like for them to clearly picture a scene of rich detail and texture and hold this scene indefinitely.<br>
  <br>
  Here is where using your imagination in the wildest, most effective ways for yourself, gives you the ability to play in a most powerful way.<br>
  <br>
  Search for all those personal images, dreams, symbols, feelings, memories, books you&#39;ve read, music, fairy tales ... sift through all those resources in your personal history that pertain and LIGHT UP to this goal and make it more 4-dimensional than a flat string of words.&nbsp; Play with this until you actually have some ENERGY there behind the desire, some really good feelings about what it will be like to you when you ALREADY HAVE this ability and then POUR THAT INTO YOUR FOOD.&nbsp; You can also imagine the food or drink just SUCKS all these Technicolor feelings into it like a powerful magnet (but this seems to be more effective with the magnetic water exercise.)<br>
  <br>
  Then you have a very interesting hook going on as your body absorbs this materially and it becomes a part of your physical being. You can almost feel this processing deep within your physical form in a way that cannot help but to manifest in just a matter of time...<br>

  <br>
  What you (emc) describe applies also to the creation of the auto-suggestion phrases and the technique of auto-suggestion in general.&nbsp; The eucharistic magic and auto-suggestion are closely related.<br>
  <br>
  There is one consideration that I would like to add to what emc said so well. It&#39;s very common when you begin to work with the eucharistic magic, to push the idea into the substance in an almost physical way.&nbsp; Many will hold their breath and grunt or strain their muscles in some way, furrow their brow, etc., all in an effort to physically and energetically force the idea into the substance. This is a waste of energy.<br>
  <br>
  This Step One and Two work of impregnation with an idea, is done entirely with the mind. What you&#39;re doing is placing your idea into the Akasha resident within the substance and the only thing that has power in the Akasha is the mind or mental body.<br>
  <br>
  So, it&#39;s far more productive to expend that energy mentally instead of physically. Physical movements might support your mental process and help you focus your mind, but the power of the eucharistic magic resides solely with the mind. Ultimately, the eucharist requires only a brief, very focused thought.<br>
  <br>

<p align=left><br>
  The <I>Step One</I> magic of breath, food and water -- the Eucharistic magics -- are probably THE most misunderstood exercises of Step One.&nbsp; Bardon did a fairly poor job of clearly expressing himself in that section so it takes reading it with a fine toothed comb to get at the true essence of the Eucharistic magic (EM).<br>
  <br>
  The EM is solely about the Akasha-mind connection.&nbsp; It is not an exercise in the accumulation or projection of astra-physical energy.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  The Akasha is resident within every physical thing and it is this resident Akasha within the substance that one impresses their thoughts upon.&nbsp; The Akasha within the air we breath (not the Air Element) is the root cause of that air.&nbsp; When we impregnate this Akasha with our ideation, we are effectively adding our ideation to the root causation.&nbsp; When we then inhale the air thus impregnated, we are also inhaling its resident Akasha that carries the impression of our ideation.&nbsp; This quanta of air-Akasha then merges with the Akasha resident in our own cells as the blood circulates and transfers the ideation into our own cells via the Akasha.&nbsp; As the root causation of matter, the ideation we have impressed upon the Akasha, weaves itself into the mental, astral and eventually, the physical matrix which surrounds the Akasha.<br>
  <br>
  The EM is a completely mental exercise.&nbsp; The only thing you use is your mind.&nbsp; First you mentally formulate your ideation and then you transfer your ideation into the substance <I>with your mind alone</I>.&nbsp; This takes no exertion of energy.&nbsp; All it takes is mental will and the attitude of complete self-assurance.&nbsp; You must know, without a doubt, that your idea has been transferred to the Akasha resident in the substance.<br>
  <br>
  When you ingest the impregnated substance you must again have no doubt that it is invading every aspect of your being.&nbsp; It will, by simple course of nature, do this in any event, whether you participate consciously or not.<br>
  <br>
  I find that it is frequently very difficult to convince folks of the simplicity of the EM, but it really is a very simple exercise.&nbsp; Mostly, it&#39;s a matter of stepping out of your own way and stop making it so difficult.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Just let your mind do the work.<br>
  <br>
      The EM is closely related to auto-suggestion.<br>
      <br>
  &gt;&gt; <I>EYE BATHING:&nbsp; I can't figure out how this one is working anymore.&nbsp; I thought that Water Magic was mostly based on using the magnetic properties of Water, but if I'm not using magnetism isn't that a bit outside the spirit in which this section has been written (Water Magic) ? I don't feel like this one has been intended to be charged through Ak&acirc;sha, am I wrong ?</I> &lt;&lt;<br>
  <br>
    It <I>IS</I> a confusing matter, so don&#39;t feel alone!&nbsp; In this section, Bardon talks about the magnetic properties of cold water and uses the term &quot;magnetizing&quot; but he does not explain *how* to magnetize the cold water.&nbsp; All he talks about *doing* in Step One is impregnating substances with an ideation via the resident Akasha.&nbsp; As a consequence of the fact that cold water is naturally magnetic, your ideation will also inhabit the physical molecules of the cold water very strongly, ever so slightly changing their physical structure.&nbsp; This makes for a stronger, more directly effective, charge of your mental ideation than if you were to use warm water or another substance.&nbsp; However, this &quot;magnetization&quot; is accomplished by the water itself, not by you.&nbsp; You are not instructed to employ any sort of energy other than your ideation which is attached to the resident Akasha of the water.<br>
  <br>
  To truly magnetize a thing requires the accumulation and projection of the Magnetic Fluid and this is NOT what Bardon is suggesting here.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  Why Bardon phrased these things in this confusing manner here and why he mentions the magnetic eye bath for the development of clairvoyance (which doesn&#39;t come until much later in IIH) are both mysteries to me.&nbsp; IMO, this is a very poorly written section since it seems to confuse the heck out of most everybody.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  The only way I made my own way through this part way back when &#91;;-)&#93; was to take that section apart, word by word, like you describe with translating my own writing.&nbsp; When broken down in this way and analysed intensively, it became apparent that Bardon did NOT intend for the student to be manipulating the Magnetic Fluid (i.e., &quot;magnetizing&quot;) at this stage.<br>
  <br>
