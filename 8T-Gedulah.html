<p align=left><B>Gedulah<br>
</B><B><br>
</B>From the Form-pole of Geburah-<I>differentiation</I>, we pass now to the Force-pole of Gedulah-<I>similarity</I>.&nbsp; Gedulah (pronounced &quot;gedd-you-lah&quot;) means &quot;greatness, majesty, magnificence&quot; and is therefore associated with the majestically large, gaseous planet Jupiter.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    In the Hebrew Tradition, this sphere is also given the title Chesed (pronounced &quot;hess-ed&quot; with a glottal, back of the throat &#39;h&#39;) which means &quot;mercy, compassion, loving kindness&quot;.&nbsp; Associated with Gedulah/Chesed is the god-name EL, which translates simply as &quot;god&quot;.&nbsp; This EL-god is masculine and singular, unlike the ELOHIM-god whose Hebrew name signifies a mixture of masculine and feminine.&nbsp; EL is, essentially, the masculine, forceful aspect of the ELOHIM.<br> 
    <br>
    As the supreme deity of the Olympian pantheon, Jupiter/Zeus is the archetypal symbol of the (mostly) benevolent, fatherly sovereign.&nbsp; This is the Divine Provider, the highest manifestation of the intimately <I>personal</I>, human concept of &quot;god&quot;.&nbsp; Which is to say, Jupiter/Zeus stands just below the higher deity forms which are <I>impersonal </I>and <I>universal</I>.<br> 
    <br>
    As the non-sequentialized potentials of Binah/Saturn descend into the realm of sequence, the first level of sequentialization they encounter is <I>similarity</I>.&nbsp; Similarity is an attractive Force which binds the Binah-potentials together by virtue of their alikeness and commonality.&nbsp; This primal Force is typified by its qualities of love, mercy, inclusiveness and expansiveness.&nbsp; This sequentialization of the Binah-potentials by virtue of their similarity, causes them to form Individual groupings.&nbsp; At this level though, these Individuals are more united than they are separate -- in Gedulah, separation is a quality defined by degree of alikeness, not by degree of difference.<br> 
    <br>
    As we rise upwards, Gedulah marks the most rarified aspect of the Individual-self.&nbsp; Conversely, as the universal Being descends into manifestation, Gedulah marks the most primitive beginnings of Individuation.&nbsp; In Qabbala, Individuation has four basic stages: assimilation, differentiation, expression and personalization.&nbsp; The <I>personalization </I>is represented by the spheres Malkuth, Yesod, Hod and Netzach, through which the Individual-self takes on concrete physical form.&nbsp; The <I>expression </I>is symbolized by the radiant solarity of Tiphareth.&nbsp; The <I>differentiation </I>is symbolized by the exclusivity of Geburah where the Individual learns to constrict its boundaries and define itself by virtue of what it is not.&nbsp; The <I>assimilation </I>is symbolized by Gedulah/Jupiter, for here the Individual is an expansive thing, capable only of inclusiveness.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    The ability of our Individual-consciousness to broaden its focus and encompass &#39;other&#39; within its definition of &#39;self&#39;, is a higher, more potent power than its concurrent ability to bring those boundaries into the sharply limited focus of a physically manifest personal-self.&nbsp; In other words, the primal attractive force of loving kindness -- because it works through alikeness and threads of commonality!!! -- is even more powerful than the secondary repulsive force of severity and differentiation.&nbsp; The power experienced in the Geburah/Mars Temple is as nothing when compared to the power of loving kindness to be experienced in the Gedulah/Jupiter Temple.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    In the Western Hermetic Tradition, Jupiter is associated with the major arcana Tarot card, <I>X: Wheel of Fortune</I>.&nbsp; This card symbolizes the cyclic force of change, typically called destiny, fortune or luck.&nbsp; In very concrete terms, Gedulah/Jupiter is that finger of change which ceaselessly touches the body of the present-moment.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    The force of change (i.e., loving kindness, inclusiveness, expansiveness) works through alikeness.&nbsp; Change/future is always connected, as if by a thread, to the what-has-been/what-is, establishing a certain recognizable continuity of events (i.e., evident causality).&nbsp; The present is related directly to the past by virtue of these threads of commonality/causality&nbsp; upon which change is ceaselessly wrought.&nbsp; Exercising our free will within the confines of our present-moments&#39; <I>now</I>-ness, we can self-consciously establish the what-is and to a great extent determine what threads of commonality are available for change to touch.&nbsp; But, as sequentialized Individuals, we have no power over <I>which </I>among those threads change will actually touch, nor do we have power over <I>how </I>and <I>why </I>change will touch them.<br> 
    <br>
    As we each know from personal experience, we have free will to either accept or rebel against the ceaselessness of change.&nbsp; From within the confines of our present-moments&#39; <I>now</I>-ness, we either face forward into that change and meet it gladly, or we look back to our what-has-been and cling to its comforting illusion of changelessness, or we try perhaps to balance ourselves somewhere in between these poles.&nbsp; But whatever we do, we are powerless to alter the fact that change is ceaseless.&nbsp; Even looking back, we are swept forward.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    In essence, our *Individual* free will extends only within the limits of our *present-moment* experience of <I>now</I>-ness.&nbsp; The Gedulah/Jupiter force of change is what forms our <I>now</I>-ness, it is what draws our <I>now </I>forward through sequence.&nbsp; Within the confines of our <I>now</I>, our one true power is our innate ability to determine how we ride the ever-cresting wave of change -- our ability to orient ourselves in such a way that change becomes for us a creative, positive, lovingly kind Force.&nbsp; This is our ability to *consciously* move forward *with* our <I>now</I>.<br> 
    <br>
    Forwardness to the Individual is the expansion of self, for as the Individual passes through the realm of sequence, it encompasses within itself all the sequence it&#39;s passed through.&nbsp; The Individual-self encompasses its past within the <I>now</I>-ness of its present-moment.&nbsp; In other words, the Individual grows.&nbsp; Indeed, growth is a primary expression of the aliveness which typifies all sequentialized Individual things.<br> 
    <br>
    The Individual does not die in the same way that the personal- and physical-selves do.&nbsp; The Individual passes through sequence until it matures and comes to encompass the whole infinity of sequence.&nbsp; This encompassing of the whole is a sort of death in that the end is thereby encompassed, but it is the opposite of physical death&#39;s finality.&nbsp; It is instead, a passage into <I>all </I>of Life, with a capital &#39;L&#39;.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    Gedulah/Jupiter is the primary manifestation/Individuation of Life and stands right at the lower threshold of the encompassing of the whole.&nbsp; Gedulah receives the descending Binah-potentials and expands with them.&nbsp; In other words, this is the lower side of the interface of the non-sequential and the sequential.&nbsp; Our perspective is from within the realm of sequence and we are looking upwards, perceiving the effects of the Binah-potentials entering our sequentialized realm.&nbsp; We experience this entry as the force of change which defines the forwardness of our present-moment <I>now</I>-ness.<br> 
    <br>
    The non-sequentialized Binah-potentials are infinite in number, so from within the realm of sequence, the process of sequentialization is never completed -- its duration is infinite.&nbsp; Thus change (our perception of the Binah-potentials entering our realm of sequence), is ceaseless, for since the Binah-potentials are infinite in number, they will <I>always </I>be descending into the sequential realm.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    We sequentialized beings witness the Creation from front-row seats, as it were.&nbsp; The lovingly kind force of change <I>is </I>the Creation, happening in right-now real-time and we are planted smack dab at the center of the action.&nbsp; The Creation doesn&#39;t just happen around us, it is happening within us and it is we who are being ceaselessly Created.<br> 
    <br>
    Paul Foster Case wrote, in his <I>Pattern on the Trestleboard</I>, statement number 4: &quot;From the exhaustless riches of its Limitless Substance, I draw all things needful, both spiritual and material.&quot;&nbsp; The infinite number of descending Binah-potentials <I>are </I>the Limitless Substance -- out of which our bubble of <I>now</I>-ness is formed and from which we therefore draw all things needful (a Gedulah/Jupiter process of <I>assimilation</I>, change and growth).<br> 
    <br>
    Our Gedulah/Jupiter meditation will focus on Case&#39;s statement.&nbsp; We will begin by rising through the six Temples we&#39;ve already visited.&nbsp; We will do this as if we were putting on a ritual robe.&nbsp; Each Temple/sphere we pass through, we will gather to ourselves and wear as a part of our own bodies.

<p align=left>As we rise from Netzach up to Tiphareth (6), we will visualize Netzach as an emerald-green sphere and place it at our left hip.&nbsp; With Malkuth at our feet, Yesod at our groin, Hod at our right hip and Netzach permeating our left hip, we rise to Tiphareth.<br> 
      <br>
      As we rise from Tiphareth up-and-over to Geburah (5), we will visualize Tiphareth as a radiant golden sun and place it at the center of our chest.&nbsp; With Malkuth at our feet, Yesod at our groin, Hod at our right hip, Netzach at our left hip, and Tiphareth shining at our solar-plexus, we rise to Geburah.<br> 
      <br>
      As we rise from Geburah over to Gedulah (4), we will visualize Geburah as a vivid red sphere and place it at our right shoulder.&nbsp; With Malkuth at our feet, Yesod at our groin, Hod at our right hip, Netzach at our left hip, Tiphareth at our solar-plexus, and Geburah permeating our right shoulder, we rise to the Gedulah Temple.&nbsp; Gedulah is brought into this luminous body as a sphere of bright sky-blue and is placed at the left shoulder.<br> 
      <br>
      In the Gedulah/Jupiter Temple, we will focus sharply upon what it feels like to be wearing this luminous body.&nbsp; Our visualization will shift to that of the pictured Tiphareth-Diamond and we will consciously radiate our Individual Light through the mist of descending Binah-potentials.<br> 
      <br>
      Here in Gedulah Temple, these Binah-potentials are symbolized by water.&nbsp; The central fountain and the four corner pillars each emit the Waters of Mercy.&nbsp; The sequentialized cyclicity of the Waters of Mercy cause the appearance of an upper- and a lower-Waters.&nbsp; The four Elemental-poles of the upper-Waters meet to form a great thunder cloud which rains down upon the lower-Waters and sends down bolts of Life-giving lightning into the atmosphere between these Waters.&nbsp; The lower-Waters spring forth and rise upwards to meet the rain and lightning descending from the upper-Waters.&nbsp; Once met, the homogenous Waters, upper now comingled with lower, fall together into manifestation.&nbsp; <br> 
      <br>
  Standing as radiant Individual Diamond-stars, situated at the point of <I>now</I>-ness where/when the upper- and lower-Waters comingle, we will focus upon the rainbow we form within the ever-changing, ever-transient Water vapor.&nbsp; We will draw from this Limitless Substance all things needful to us in our <I>now</I>-ness, and ride consciously with the ever-cresting wave of right-now real-time change.&nbsp; Our focus will be nose-to-nose with the descending infinity of Binah-potentials and we will explore the cutting-edge feel of what it means to be constantly Created . . . to be ceaselessly re-Created.<br> 
  <br>
  The spherical rainbow refracted by the vapor of the Waters of Mercy is the equivalent of our luminous bodies.&nbsp; The rainbow demonstrates Individuation-by-similarity, for even though its colors are created by different spectra of light, it is still a unified, coherent, inter-related whole.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  Each color becomes the next color in the sequence by degrees of alikeness -- red passes along the commonality/causality of yellow and by an infinite succession of degrees, it becomes green.&nbsp; The rainbow, like our luminous body, is one of an infinite number of Individual microcosmic manifestations of the macrocosm.&nbsp; An Individual microcosmic body directly mirrors the overall structure of the macrocosm, but it does not contain the whole infinity of possibilities encompassed by <I>macro</I>-cosm.&nbsp; <br> 
  <br>
  Our Gedulah Temple meditation will end with a simple ritual of &quot;high magic&quot; -- we will consciously descend into our luminous body, consciously filling it and causing it to be.&nbsp; As we return to Malkuth we will be wrapping ourselves in this garment and forming with it our daily life circumstances.&nbsp; It is &quot;high magic&quot; because our daily life is in fact, the present-moment, real-time, highly sequentialized manifestation of our luminous body.&nbsp; <br>

    Begin as usual: pass through the Cave Entrance, along the Tunnel passage, up the ten steps, and into the Malkuth Temple where I stand awaiting your arrival.<br> 
    <br>
    When all the participants have arrived, I will gather us together and cast a ritual circle.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    Once our circle is cast, we will spend several moments together in the center of the Malkuth Temple, holding hands in a circle and bringing our awareness of the presences of the other participants into focus.&nbsp; As you look around the circle, try to sense the unique presence of each participant.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    At the appropriate moment, I will bring our focus to the East quarter altar -- our gateway to Gedulah.&nbsp; Upon the altar, we see the square fountain of the Waters of Mercy. Standing within this spray of Water is the radiant, central Diamond from the Tiphareth Temple.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    Behind the altar, we see the same curtain and symbol we encounter at the Cave Entrance.<br>
    As I light the candles upon the altar, we speak, as with a single voice, the phrase: <I><B>&quot;El, please guide me to Gedulah.&quot;</B></I>

<p align=left>As we pass from Hod to Netzach, we add a Hod-sphere at our right hip.&nbsp; Passing still upwards, we add a Netzach-sphere at our left hip, then a Tiphareth-sphere at our solar plexus, and then a Geburah-sphere at our right shoulder.&nbsp; This brings us into the Gedulah Temple and we add a Gedulah-sphere at our left shoulder.&nbsp; When all have arrived in Gedulah Temple, we will pause for a few moments of orientation.

<p align=left>&nbsp;</p>
<p align=left>At the appropriate moment, I will bring our circle together and we will focus sharply upon the presences of the other Individual participants.&nbsp; Notice the subtle differences which distinguish one Individual from another and then pointedly shift your attention to the <I>similarities </I>which render each recognizable as an Individual.&nbsp; See how the luminous body of one (though Individually unique) is alike the luminous body of each of the others.<br> 
    <br>
    Next we will look just as sharply within ourselves.&nbsp; Turn your attention inward and sense, as deeply as possible, what it feels like for you to wear your luminous body.&nbsp; Flow along the commonality/causality thread of your luminous body&#39;s <I>radiance </I>and merge with your Tiphareth-Diamond self.&nbsp; Stand, as illustrated, at the meeting place where the upper- and lower-Waters commingle.<br> 
    <br>
    We will then spend several minutes in private meditation upon Paul Case&#39;s statement &#35;4: &quot;From the exhaustless riches of its Limitless Substance, I draw all things needful, both spiritual and material.&quot;&nbsp; Try, as you meditate, to place yourself firmly in the present-moment <I>now</I>-ness.&nbsp; From within that <I>now</I>-ness, face directly into the ever-cresting wave of change and try your best to reorient yourself so that instead of <I>it </I>washing over <I>you</I>, you wash down <I>with </I>it.&nbsp; Seek out your place <I>within </I>the ever-cresting wave of change and flow <I>with </I>it.<br> 
    <br>
    Feel yourself as a radiant being, stationed precisely at that point in time-space where/when the future penetrates the present.&nbsp; As you radiate into the ever-changing, ever-new Limitless Substance of Water vapor, draw from it what is needful to the ceaseless reCreation of your luminous body.&nbsp; Observe the threads of commonality/causality which sustain the continuity of your luminous body.&nbsp; Though it exists within the medium of ever-newness and is ceaselessly reCreated, it still manifests a specific continuity -- it is continuously this thing you recognize as your luminous body.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    Examine, explore and learn by direct experience all that you can of this realm of ever-new <I>now</I>-ness.<br> 
    <br>
    At the appropriate moment I will bring our focus together and we will begin the ritual of conscious descent into Malkuth.&nbsp; I utter the word <I><B>Gedulah </B></I>and sphere 4 of our luminous bodies shines forth strongly at the left shoulder.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    I utter the word <I><B>Geburah </B></I>and we are transited to the Geburah Temple.&nbsp; We bring our Gedulah bodies into Geburah and sphere 5 at our right shoulder shines forth.&nbsp; Take a moment to sense how the power of Geburah, since you&#39;ve touched Gedulah, now has about it a sense of inspiration.&nbsp; See how the Gedulah force of Loving Kindness fills and gives a nobility of purpose to the form of your Geburian powerfulness.&nbsp; Let Loving Kindness permeate all of your powerfulness.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    I utter the word <I><B>Tiphareth </B></I>and we are transited to the Tiphareth Temple.&nbsp; As before, we bring our higher Gedulah-Geburah bodies into Tiphareth and sphere 6 becomes a radiant sun which fills our chest cavities.&nbsp; Sense how the quality of your radiations are changed by the Gedulah-inspiration and the inspired Geburah-powerfulness.<br> 
    <br>
    I utter the word <I><B>Netzach </B></I>and our Gedulah-Geburah-Tiphareth bodies are transited to the Netzach Temple.&nbsp; As sphere 7 shines forth at your left hip, sense how your emotional realm is changed and matured to a higher nobility by your having brought your higher body consciously down into it.<br> 
    <br>
    I utter the word <I><B>Hod </B></I>and we are transited to the Hod Temple.&nbsp; As sphere 8 shines forth at your right hip, sense how the presence of your higher body refines and clarifies your powers of intellection and reason.<br> 
    <br>
    I utter the word <I><B>Yesod </B></I>and we are transited to the Yesod Temple.&nbsp; As sphere 9 shines forth and fills your pelvic cavity, sense how your higher body coalesces and becomes the coherent personality you manifest.<br> 
    <br>
    I utter the word <I><B>Malkuth </B></I>and our Gedulah-Geburah-Tiphareth-Netzach-Hod-Yesod bodies transit gently to the Malkuth Temple.&nbsp; Sphere 10 forms itself solidly at our feet and we stand firmly planted upon it.&nbsp; We stand, wearing our <I>whole </I>luminous body in Malkuth.&nbsp; Sense what wearing your luminous body in Malkuth feels like for you personally.<br> 
    <br>
    We will close with a short meditation on Paul Case&#39;s statement &#35;10: &quot;The Kingdom of Spirit is embodied in my flesh.&quot;&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    At the appropriate moment, I will draw us together and, holding hands, luminous body joined to luminous body in a circle, we will offer up our prayers of thanks.&nbsp; Then I will release the circle casting and we will bid our goodbyes.<br> 
    <br>
    As you leave the Malkuth Temple, do so with great self-consciousness.&nbsp; Concentrate upon your luminous body and consciously move <I>with </I>it, down the stairs, through the tunnel and out the Cave entrance.&nbsp; Take the awareness and sensation of your luminous body with you as you return to normal physical awareness.&nbsp; When you are firmly back into your physical body, take a few minutes more to yourself and visualize your luminous body surrounding and permeating you.&nbsp; As you get up and go about your business, try to keep this awareness of your luminous body with you for as long as you can.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <B>Follow-up Work -- </B><br> 
    <br>
    As always, write down some notes summarizing your experience.<br> 
    <br>
    In the days immediately following your Gedulah meditation, take time periodically to visualize your luminous body.&nbsp; Remember to <I>wear </I>it and while wearing it, examine those threads of commonality / causality which connect your luminous body to the circumstances of your daily life.&nbsp; Acquaint yourself thoroughly with your luminous body.<br> 
    <br>
    Don&#39;t hesitate to project your personal shield if working with your luminous body makes you feel at all vulnerable.&nbsp; Your shield and your luminous body are quite compatible and the one will augment the other.<br> 
    <br>
    Return regularly to the Gedulah Temple and pursue there the work of fine tuning the self-crafting of your Individuality.&nbsp; Thoroughly familiarize yourself with the <I>now </I>and with the threads of causality connecting past with future.&nbsp; Set your imagination free and experiment with the manipulation of those threads of causality.&nbsp; <br> 
    <br>
    Working directly with the causal threads that permeate and sustain the universe is a very high form of magic called &quot;Causality Magic&quot;.&nbsp; Only an Individual who is well along the path of self-crafting and who has truly learned the lessons of Geburah, is allowed access to this high a magic.&nbsp; In other words, one is led to this higher ability <I>only </I>by successfully passing through the lessons of Geburah -- there is no other entry than that, for there is no such thing as a short cut to the higher magics!<br>
